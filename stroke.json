Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism identified the following polymorphisms: Thr325Ile and Ala147Thr in TAFI, 4G/5G in PAI-1, PLA1/A2 in platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, Glu298Asp in eNOS, and C677T in 5,10-MTHFR. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the independent risk of stroke.\n204 cases and 204 age- and sex-matched controls were included in the study. Clinical and genetic variables associated with ischaemic stroke were hypertension (P=.03), tobacco use (P=.02), and the polymorphisms Glu298Asp (genotype: P=.001, allele frequency: P=.001) and C677T (genotype: P=.01); the Ala147Thr, Thr325IIe, 4G/5G, and PLA1/A2 mutations were not associated with ischaemic stroke. The 298Asp (P=.03) and T (P=.01) alleles, hypertension (P=.03), tobacco use (P=.01) and family history of stroke (P=.04) were identified as independent risk factors.\nThe polymorphisms Glu298Asp and C677T, affecting the eNOS and 5,10-MTHFR enzymes, respectively, and smoking, hypertension, and family history of stroke were associated with ischaemic stroke in young Mexican patients; this was not the case for the Thr325Ile, Ala147Thr, 4G/5G, and PLA1/A2 polymorphisms of the genes coding for fibrinolytic proteins and platelet receptors.",

        "abstract": "\nTo examine how patients spend their time in stroke rehabilitation units in England.\nWe recruited 144 patients within a month after stroke from four stroke rehabilitation units and observed their activity type, interactions and location. Each participant was observed for 1&#8201;min every 10-minutes, for a total of 20&#8201;h, over three consecutive days. Multilevel modelling was performed to assess differences across sites.\nAcross the four sites a total of 12,248 observations were performed. Patients spent on average 37% of the observed time inactive and 60% alone. A health care professional was present for 18% of the observations and patients' most frequent contact was with family members (19%). Patients were mainly physically active in the presence of therapists, but they practiced self-care activities of daily living most frequently in the presence of nursing staff. There were limited opportunities for activity away from the bedside. Significant differences were found between the units, including patients' level of contact with rehabilitation assistants and nursing staff, but not in their time with occupational therapists and physiotherapists.\nStroke patients in England spend a large proportion of their day inactive and alone. Opportunities to promote a rehabilitation focused environment may include: a) enhancing the role of rehabilitation assistants, b) supporting nursing staff in maximising opportunities for the practice of activities of daily living and c) involving family members in the rehabilitation process.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONClinicians need to consider stroke patients' activity levels and rehabilitation experience outside formal therapy.The role of rehabilitation assistants and nursing staff can be key in promoting patient activity and practice of self-care ADL tasks.Pragmatic strategies to encourage family involvement in the rehabilitation process need to be developed.",

Characterizing the visual functioning of persons with aphasia is imperative in both clinical and research domains; however, visual functioning of persons with aphasia is infrequently assessed or described in either domain.\nThis study aims to examine the utility of various visual screening measures as indicated by Hallowell (2008) and document the results of the screening tools for a cohort of persons with aphasia.\nTwenty-three individuals with chronic aphasia completed a detailed vision screening using a visual case history, the Visual Activities Questionnaire, the McDowell Vision Screening, an Amsler grid, the line bisection task, and the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale item 3-visual.\nTwo-thirds of the participants reported significant visual histories with only one participant reporting stroke-related visual deficits. On average, the group rated visual difficulty during daily activities as never or rarely occurring, with the least difficulty reported for color discrimination and the most difficulty with visual acuity and visual search, though still only occurring rarely. All participants passed the cover/uncover screening task measuring ocular alignment and motility, the color perception screening task, and several tasks measuring ocular function. Failing scores, however, were assigned for about half of the participants for distance visual acuity, and only three participants for near visual acuity. Visual fields were normal for about two-thirds of the participants and all participants presented with normal visual attention.\nThe results suggest that visual deficits are common in persons with aphasia, but are not necessarily related to the stroke that the person experienced. The results highlight the need to screen the vision of persons with aphasia both for clinical purposes and research protocols to ensure visual deficits are treated, compensated for, or controlled.",

        "title": "Mechanism, spectrum, consequences and management of hyponatremia in tuberculous meningitis.",
        "abstract": "\nHyponatremia is the commonest electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients and is associated with poor outcome. Hyponatremia is categorized on the basis of serum sodium into severe (< 120 mEq/L), moderate (120-129 mEq/L) and mild (130-134mEq/L) groups. Serum sodium has an important role in maintaining serum osmolality, which is maintained by the action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secreted from the posterior pituitary, and natriuretic peptides such as atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide. These peptides act on kidney tubules via the renin angiotensin aldosterone system. Hyponatremia <120mEq/L or a rapid decline in serum sodium can result in neurological manifestations, ranging from confusion to coma and seizure. Cerebral salt wasting (CSW) and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH) are important causes of hyponatremia in tuberculosis meningitis (TBM). CSW is more common than SIADH. The differentiation between CSW and SIADH is important because treatment of one may be detrimental for the other; evidence of hypovolemia in CSW and euvolemia or hypervolemia in SIADH is used for differentiation. In addition, evidence of dehydration, polyuria, negative fluid balance as assessed by intake output chart, weight loss, laboratory evidence and sometimes central venous pressure are helpful in the diagnosis of these disorders. Volume contraction in CSW may be more protracted than hyponatremia and may contribute to border zone infarctions in TBM. Hyponatremia should be promptly and carefully treated by saline and oral salt, while 3% saline should be used in severe hyponatremia with coma and seizure. In refractory patients with hyponatremia, fludrocortisone helps in early normalization of serum sodium without affecting polyuria or functional outcome. In SIADH, V2 receptor antagonist conivaptan or tolvaptan may be used if the patient is not responding to fluid restriction. Fluid restriction in SIADH has not been found to be beneficial in TBM and should be avoided.",

        "title": "A Prospective Evaluation of Swallowing and Speech in Patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 2.",
        "abstract": "\nObjective &#8195;Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) patients report that swallowing and speech problems significantly affect their quality of life, but the etiology of these phenomena is poorly understood. Swallowing and speech deficits may arise due to the neuropathy of involved nerves, due to posterior fossa tumor growth, or as iatrogenic effects from neurosurgical procedures to remove these tumors. This study aims to identify the natural history of swallowing and speech deficits in an NF2 cohort and to characterize the factors that may lead to those deficits. Methods &#8195;Subjects ( n &#8201;=&#8201;168) were enrolled in a prospective, longitudinal study of NF2 with yearly imaging and clinical exams. The patients completed a self-reported questionnaire that included responses regarding subjective swallowing and speech dysfunction. A formal speech-language pathology evaluation and modified barium swallow (MBS) study (reported as American Speech-Language Hearing Association [ASHA] swallowing independency score from 1 through 7) was obtained when a speech/swallowing deficit was reported on the questionnaire. Results &#8195;Of the 168 enrolled subjects, 55 (33%, median age&#8201;=&#8201;31 years) reported subjective speech and/or swallowing deficits. These patients underwent one ( n &#8201;=&#8201;37) or multiple ( n &#8201;=&#8201;18) MBS studies during 44.8&#8201;&#177;&#8201;10.4 months follow-up. During MBS, a majority demonstrated near-normal swallowing (ASHA score >6, 82%), and no evidence of aspiration (aspiration/laryngeal penetration score&#8201;=&#8201;1, 96%). Prior to initial MBS consultation, 38 (69%) patients had undergone relevant neurosurgical procedures. In those with recent (<1 week) posterior fossa surgery ( n &#8201;=&#8201;12), 2 (17%) patients had severe dysphagia and high aspiration risk on postoperative MBS. Both of these patients recovered to functionally independent swallowing status. Unilateral ( n &#8201;=&#8201;10) or bilateral ( n &#8201;=&#8201;6) tongue deficits unrelated to previous history suggestive of hypoglossal nerve injury were detected on clinical examination. There was a correlation between the presence of dysarthria and tongue deficits and tumors associated with the hypoglossal canal noted on imaging. Conclusion &#8195;A large proportion of patients with NF2 report speech and swallow deficits that are not evident on objective measurements. We also found hypoglossal neuropathy unrelated to prior surgical interventions. Our findings suggest that swallowing and speech problems in NF2 are associated with lower cranial nerve neuropathy, some due to compressive effects of posterior fossa tumors. Adaptation over the course of the disease allows for the compensation of these deficits and subsequent normal findings on objective testing.",

        "abstract": "\nSoft wearable robots could provide support for lower and upper limbs, increase weight lifting ability, decrease energy required for walking and running, and even provide haptic feedback. However, to date most of wearable robots are based on electromagnetic motors or fluidic actuators, the former being rigid and bulky, the latter requiring external pumps or compressors, greatly limiting integration and portability. Here we describe a new class of electrically-driven soft fluidic muscles combining thin, fiber-like McKibben actuators with fully Stretchable Pumps. These pumps rely on ElectroHydroDynamics, a solid-state pumping mechanism that directly accelerates liquid molecules by means of an electric field. Requiring no moving parts, these pumps are silent and can be bent and stretched while operating. Each electrically-driven fluidic muscle consists of one Stretchable Pump and one thin McKibben actuator, resulting in a slender soft device weighing 2 g. We characterized the response of these devices, obtaining a blocked force of 0.84 N and a maximum stroke of 4 mm. Future work will focus on decreasing the response time and increasing the energy efficiency. Modular and straightforward to integrate in textiles, these electrically-driven fluidic muscles will enable soft smart clothing with multi-functional capabilities for human assistance and augmentation.",

        "abstract": "\nWhen a person experiences a severe stroke, their relatives must assume the role of partners in the rehabilitation process. Drawing on Bourdieu's field theory, we investigated the potential gap between the subjective expectations of relatives in terms of the assistance and care they can offer patients with severe brain injuries and the objective constraints of a healthcare field. Using data from observations, as well as interviews with relatives and official documents, our study shows how some relatives, reliant on their habitus, bring to their collaboration with healthcare professionals an expectation that the healthcare field will be able to take care of their multiple individual needs. However, due to hysteresis - a gap between their dispositions and the objective possibilities of the transformed healthcare field - these relatives are not equipped to recognise, grasp and occupy their new field position. We conclude that Bourdieu's theoretical concept of hysteresis may help to understand how changes in the healthcare field may lead to a mismatch between the field and the habitus manifested in interactions between patients, relatives and healthcare professionals, so that the ill-adjusted habitus of relatives leads to missed chances in relation to the opportunities objectively offered by the field.",

Serious cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction or stroke are life-threatening events which might in turn lead to changes in VoA. The present longitudinal study examined the effect of a cardiovascular event (CVE) on VoA over a three-year period using pooled data from three waves of the German Ageing Survey (2008, 2011, 2014, age range: 40-95&#160;years). In order to account for alternative explanations for changes in VoA, individuals without CVE (n&#8201;=&#8201;200) were matched to individuals who experienced a CVE (n&#8201;=&#8201;202) using a propensity score matching procedure. Compared to individuals without CVE, individuals who experienced a CVE showed adverse changes in three VoA indicators (self-perceptions of aging as associated with physical losses/with ongoing development; subjective age). These results suggest that CVE can in fact change how individuals view their own aging. According to previous studies, this can lead to future health changes and thus become a health-related downward spiral. Health promotion programs could, therefore, profit by adding specific VoA interventions for individuals who experienced a CVE.",

Anodal tDCS improved grip force (of the contra-lesional, i.e., right hand), but had no effect on aphasia.\nData from this pilot study show that repetitive, anodal tDCS over left PPC combined with a standardized motor training expedites recovery from imitation deficits in LH stroke patients with apraxia (relative to sham stimulation). Results suggest that in patients suffering from apraxic imitation deficits a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is warranted that investigates the effects of tDCS applied over PPC in addition to a standardized motor training.",

Using random-effects models, a meta-analysis was performed to estimate the overall relative risks (RR) of stroke incidence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the individuals with the fastest walking paces vs. individuals with the slowest walking paces. A dose-response relationship was also examined.\nAfter screening 1294 titles/abstracts and 14 full-text studies identified in the search, 7 studies (from 8 cohorts) were included in the meta-analysis. The 7 studies included a total of 135,645 participants (95.2% women; mean age 63.6 years) and 2229 stroke events (median follow-up time = 8.0 years). Compared to individuals in the slowest walking-pace category (median = 1.6 km/h), individuals in the fastest walking-pace category (median = 5.6 km/h) had a 44% lower risk of stroke (pooled RR = 0.56, 95%CI: 0.48-0.65). There was also a linear dose-response relationship (RR = 0.87; 95%CI: 0.83-0.91), with the risk of stroke decreased by 13% for every 1 km/h increment in baseline walking pace. We observed similar results across walking-pace assessment, type of stroke ascertainment, stroke subtypes, sex, sample size, and duration of follow-up.\nFindings from this meta-analysis indicate that walking pace is inversely associated with the risk of stroke.",

        "abstract": "\nStroke survivors and their caregivers report not receiving enough information at discharge. To identify strengths and weaknesses of stroke discharge education, we delivered questionnaires that assessed patient and caregiver recall, perceived utility, and satisfaction at discharge as well as 1- and 3-month follow-up. Categorical data of responses were compared between time periods using Fischer exact test. Recall significantly differed between discharge (86%) and 1-month follow-up (54%, P < .05), but not discharge and 3-month follow-up (69%). Patient perceived utility at both 1 month (69%) and 3 months (64%) was lower than at discharge (92%, P < .05). Patient satisfaction was lower at 1 month (69%) and 3 months (54%) than discharge (92%, P < .05). Caregiver recall declined from discharge (81%) to 1 month (65%) but improved from 1 to 3 months (82%, P < .05). Caregiver satisfaction and perceived utility remained positive through the study. The results suggest stroke patients and their caregivers suffer from education recall failure over time that is associated with worse satisfaction and perceived utility by patients. Reinforcement at 1 month may improve caregiver recall. We conclude that education for caregivers may be more reliably reinforced, suggesting a role in continued patient education.",

Previous research suggests that prestroke proficiency may be amongst the factors determining poststroke language impairment in BWA, however this relationship is not well understood.\nThe purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between prestroke proficiency and poststroke lexical-semantic performance in BWA and to identify common patterns of language impairment in this population.\nTwenty-seven Spanish-English BWA (14 female, age range = 29-88 years) were administered a language use questionnaire (LUQ) to measure several aspects of their bilingual language history that contribute to their prestroke proficiency in both languages. They also underwent standardized language assessments tapping lexical-semantic performance in each language. A principal component analysis was first conducted on the LUQ metrics to determine the factors that contributed to prestroke proficiency in each language. Next, regression analyses allowed assessing the relationships between prestroke proficiency and poststroke lexical-semantic performance in both languages. Differences in proficiency and language performance across languages were contrasted prior and after stroke to identify profiles of impairment.\nPrestroke proficiency in the native language was determined by daily use, educational history, lifetime exposure, and language ability rating. Prestroke proficiency in the second language was determined by age of acquisition, daily use, educational history, lifetime exposure, lifetime confidence, family proficiency, and language ability rating. Prestroke proficiency significantly predicted poststroke lexical-semantic performance in BWA in both languages. Twenty-two participants presented parallel impairment while only three presented differential impairment.\nOur results confirm that prestroke language proficiency is a key predictor of poststroke language impairment in BWA. These findings have important implications for the assessment and diagnosis of aphasia in bilingual individuals.",

There is a paucity of data on the impact of anemia on early functional outcomes.\nTo determine the association of anemia on early functional outcomes in a cohort of patients with ischemic stroke.\nThis prospective study was conducted among 190 participants with acute ischemic stroke presenting to the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. Data were collected on socio-demographic determinants, clinical presentation, co-morbidities, subtype of stroke, and stroke severity (NIHSS score). Early functional outcomes were assessed by the Modified-Rankin-Score (mRS) and Barthel index (BI) within 48 h of the onset. Anemia was defined as Hb <13 g/dl in males and <12 g/dl in females.\nThe mean age of the population was 62.4 years (SD = 11.8). Most participants (75.8%) were males. Anemia was noted in 56.4% of the total study population (59.0% males; 56.5% females) with a mean Hb of 11.7 g/dl. A total of 20% of patients had moderate to severe stroke severity as defined by an NIHSS of &#8805;16. Functional status assessment revealed that 67.9% had mRS <3 and 85.8% had BI <75. Furthermore, 85.8% had a composite MRS <3 and/or BI 75. Univariate analysis revealed that anemia was significantly associated with \"moderate-severe\" functional disability. On logistic regression analyses, this retained significance when the functional disability was assessed by mRS >3 (adjusted OR = 2.36; 95% CI = 1.1-5.1). Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves indicated a Hb% of 10.65 g/dl as the cut-off that would predict stroke-related disability assessed by mRS >3 [sensitivity = 86.7%; specificity = 34.2%; and AUC = 0.659 (P < 0.0001)].\nAnemia is an independent determinant of poor functional disability in early acute ischemic stroke.",

Genomic DNA was prepared at S.N. Pradhan Centre of Neurosciences, University of Calcutta, Kolkata, India. Exotic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (rs429358, rs 7412) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism for genotype of APOE.\nThe frequencies of different APOE allele among 80 ischemic stroke patients were 5.6% (n = 9) for E2, 75.68% (n = 121) for E3, and 18.7% (n = 30) for E4. The E3 allele is significantly over-represented (P = 0.004) in controls compared to the patients (88% in controls vs 75.6% ischemic stroke patients and 80% hemorrhagic patients). A significantly high frequency of APOE4 allele was observed in ischemic (18.7%) and hemorrhagic patients (11%) compared to controls (8%). The E4 allele plays a major risk for developing ischemic stroke [odds ratio (OR) = 2.744; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.43-5.10] and E3 plays a protective role for hemorrhagic stroke (OR = 0.53; 95% CI: 0.29-0.96), while E4 allele plays a nonsignificant (P = 0.31) increase in trend in hemorrhage stroke (OR = 1.4).\nThere is significant association of APOE gene polymorphism in stroke patients of ethnic Bengali population.

The main objective of this study was to identify from a panel of 10 inflammatory markers and chemokines those biomarkers that have a potential predictive role in the evolution of disability and functional dependence in daily activities after an ischemic stroke.\nThe study included 116 patients with ischemic stroke and 40 healthy volunteers matched for gender and age. Stroke severity was assessed by the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on admission and during hospitalization and functional mobility in daily activities by Barthel index (BI). Multiplex panel with 10 biomarkers [brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AA, PDGF-AB/BB, neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), cathepsin D, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM), soluble intercellular cell adhesion molecule (sICAM), myeloperoxidase (MPO), regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1] was analyzed on days 1 and 5 after admission using the xMAP technology.\nPlasma concentrations of RANTES and NCAM were significantly lower in patients with ischemic stroke compared with healthy controls, while MPO and sICAM were significantly higher in patients versus controls. Plasma concentrations of sICAM, sVCAM, and RANTES significantly decreased during the analyzed period. For the first-day measurement, the bivariate analysis revealed the association of NIHSS on admission with sVCAM, and on discharge negative association with PDGF-AA, PDGR-AB/BB, BDNF, and RANTES. Plasma levels of PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB/BB, BDNF, and RANTES were found to be significantly lower in patients with BI &#8804; 80, on day 5 after disease onset. PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB/BB, and BDNF were univariate and multivariate predictors for functional dependence in daily life activity (BI &#8804; 80), having a protective effect (odds ratio < 1).\nPlasma levels of BDNF, PDGF-AA, and PDGF-AB/BB are independent predictors for functional dependency in daily life activities and may be useful prognostic markers in the evaluation of ischemic stroke patients.",

At the Brain Tumor Center, Erasmus MC, 25 patients were treated using the Kawase approach between 2004 and 2018 for various indications, including petroclival meningiomas, chondrosarcomas, pontine cavernomas, trigeminal schwannomas, and posterior circulation aneurysms. Hearing preservation was achieved in all patients; new abducens nerve and trochlear nerve palsies were present in three and six patients, respectively, of which a total of eight required ophthalmological correction. Seven patients experienced a cerebrospinal fluid fistula postoperatively, but this complication appeared self-limiting in all cases, with one patient experiencing secondary meningitis. After modifying our closure technique, the rate of fistulas dropped to zero. The observed direct postoperative mortality was 4% (one patient), although not related to the approach itself. In conclusion, the Kawase approach is a highly complex, but essential middle fossa approach, extremely robust, and able to serve a wide array of pathologies together with its extensions. It is very accurate for performing hearing preservation surgery, but not without caveats and inherent risk of complications.",

Since electrophysiological identification of pAFs can be challenging, there has been an accumulation of proposed predictors and biomarkers for pAFs. The predictive values of these is varying and sometimes conflicting among studies. Therefore, we aimed to verify a fraction of previously reported parameters for pAF detection by investigating an independent clinical sample.\nUsing a publicly available data downloaded from the MIMIC-3 intensive care unit database, we tested the predictive role of particular risk factors and biomarkers for pAF detection after ischemic stroke in 124 patients with ischemic stroke admitted within 24 hours of stroke onset.\nOur evaluation revealed a strong association of older age in women, as well as admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and discharge modified Rankin Scores (mRS) in both sexes for pAFs, in patients that were in sinus rhythm on admission. We also detected a trend for lower gender-adjusted hemoglobin in patients with pAF, although the difference was insignificant. On the other hand, we did not find any significant association of pAF detection with some other previously reported biomarkers: serum magnesium level, leukocyte count, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio or left atrial dilatation.\nEven though our analysis did not reveal a strong and specific biomarker to predict pAFs after stroke, it identified key risk factors. It may be necessary to consider the possibility of pAFs and perform rigorous evaluation to prevent further events of embolic stroke in female patients older than 75 years, with more severe neurological deficits on admission, higher disability on discharge and also with relatively lower hemoglobin level. This first study from Turkey using clinical data from the MIMIC-3 database also demonstrates the value of publicized clinical data for confirmatory studies on various medical fields across the World.",

        "abstract": "\nIndividuals with lesions of central motor pathways frequently suffer from sustained involuntary muscle activity. This symptom shares clinical characteristics with dystonia but is observable in individuals classified as spastic. The term spastic dystonia has been introduced, although the underlying mechanisms of involuntary activity are not clarified and vary between individuals depending on the disorder. This study aimed to investigate the nature and pathophysiology of sustained involuntary muscle activity in adults with cerebral palsy and stroke. Seventeen adults with cerebral palsy (Gross Motor Function Classification System I-V), 8 adults with chronic stroke and 14 control individuals participated in the study. All individuals with cerebral palsy or stroke showed increased resistance to passive movement with Modified Ashworth Scale >1. Two-minute surface EMG recordings were obtained from the biceps muscle during attempted rest in three positions of the elbow joint; a maximally flexed position, a 90-degree position and a maximally extended position. Cross-correlation analysis of sustained involuntary muscle activity from individuals with cerebral palsy and stroke, and recordings of voluntary isometric contractions from control individuals were performed to examine common synaptic drive. In total, 13 out of 17 individuals with cerebral palsy and all 8 individuals with stroke contained sustained involuntary muscle activity. In individuals with cerebral palsy, the level of muscle activity was not affected by the joint position. In individuals with stroke, the level of muscle activity significantly (P&#8201;<&#8201;0.05) increased from the flexed position to the 90 degree and extended position. Cumulant density function indicated significant short-term synchronization of motor unit activities in all recordings. All groups exhibited significant coherence in the alpha (6-15&#8201;Hz), beta (16-35&#8201;Hz) and early gamma band (36-60&#8201;Hz). The cerebral palsy group had lower alpha band coherence estimates, but higher gamma band coherence estimates compared with the stroke group. Individuals with increased resistance to passive movement due to cerebral palsy or stroke frequently suffer sustained involuntary muscle activity, which cannot exclusively be described by spasticity. The sustained involuntary muscle activity in both groups originated from a common synaptic input to the motor neuron pool, but the generating mechanisms could differ between groups. In cerebral palsy it seemed to originate more from central mechanisms, whereas peripheral mechanisms likely play a larger role in stroke. The sustained involuntary muscle activity should not be treated simply like the spinal stretch reflex mediated symptom of spasticity and should not either be treated identically in both groups.",

Genetic variant analysis was performed on thrombosis patients to detect MTHFR C677T (rs1801133), MTHFR A1298C (rs1801131), MS A2756G (rs1805087) and CBS T833C (rs5742905) mutations. The mutant allele frequencies of MTHFR 677T, MTHFR 1298C, MS2756G and CBS 833C were observed to be 16.1%, 37.5%, 34.1% and 5.8% respectively. MTHFR 677TT genotype was observed to be significantly associated with elevated homocysteine (Hcy) levels (64.65&#160;&#956;mol/L) alleles as compared to CC alleles (32.43&#160;&#956;mol/L) and CT alleles (30.54&#160;&#956;mol/L). MTHFR A1298C, MS A2756G and CBS T833C genotypes did not showed significant association with higher Hcy levels. Thus, in Indian patients with thrombosis only MTHFR T677T genotype was observed to be significantly associated with hyperhomocysteinemia.",

        "abstract": "\nThe present study was performed to evaluate the ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness as well as the significance map and analyse the time course of the change in GCC thickness in patients with homonymous hemianopia due to posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory stroke using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. This study included 40 control subjects and 11 patients with unilateral PCA territory stroke. The GCC parameters were quantified using a custom-built software programme. The GCC data, centred on the macula, was divided vertically into hemianopic and unaffected sides. GCC parameters were calculated using an average of those from both eyes. The relationship between the GCC parameters and the time after stroke was determined by regression analyses. The GCC parameters in the hemi-retinae corresponding to the affected hemifields significantly differed between the hemianopes and the control group. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of the GCC significance map areas was significantly high. A regression analysis revealed a significant relationship between the time after stroke and both the GCC significance map areas (r&#160;=&#160;0.791, p =&#160;.004) and GCC thickness (r&#160;=&#160;-0.736, p =&#160;.010) on the hemianopic side. The GCC parameters on the hemianopic side were reduced in patients with acquired occipital homonymous hemianopia, and the reduction was slowly progressive probably due to transsynaptic retrograde degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells. A significance map analysis provides additional OCT parameters that could be used to investigate the effect of retrogeniculate lesions on the inner retina of patients.",

Currently there are no national guidelines for perimetry in neurological conditions. A wide choice of perimetry programs exists. An inappropriate program choice could fail to detect visual field loss. Two phases in this study determined preference of perimetry programs for detection of visual field loss in four common neurological conditions (idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), optic neuropathies, chiasmal compression and stroke), to aid the design of research and clinical practice guidelines.\nA survey consisted of 47 perimetry programs. Orthoptists and neuro-ophthalmologists were asked which perimetry programs they considered important for use in the four neurological conditions. These programs were short-listed for discussion in a consensus meeting. A nominal group technique was used for the consensus meeting to reach consensus on the three most favoured perimetry programs appropriate for the four conditions.\nTwenty-six participants completed the survey (51% return rate). Nine programs were found to be not applicable to any of the conditions. The short-lists for the conditions varied between six and ten perimetry programs. Seven participants discussed the survey results at a consensus meeting to agree the three most favoured perimetry programs for IIH, optic neuropathy and chiasmal compression (manual/semi manual kinetic, static 30-2 and full-field 120) and for stroke (manual/semi manual kinetic, static 30-2 and monocular Esterman).\nA wide range of perimetry programmes were explored thoroughly through survey and consensus methods in order to determine clinician preference for their use in neuro-ophthalmic practice. The three most favoured perimetry programs for the four conditions was established.",

National Health Survey's data were used. The Chi-square test and the Poisson multiple regression were used to analyze data. A total of 5,575 older adults with multimorbidity and mean age of 70.3 years participated in the study. Most of them are female (66.3%), white (56.1%), are sedentary (75.3%), with low schooling (40%), no health plan (65.3%), did not consume alcohol (78.7%) and did not smoke (90.1%). The most prevalent multimorbidities were hypertension and high cholesterol (31.3%), hypertension and stroke (30.9%) and hypertension and diabetes (23.3%). There was an association of the first condition with females, younger adults and no tobacco use. On the other hand, the second condition was associated with females and low level of schooling. The third group was associated with low schooling, sedentary lifestyle and no tobacco use. We can conclude that multimorbidity in Brazilian older adults is a frequent condition in women, younger seniors and those socioeconomically disadvantaged. Also, socioeconomic conditions and lifestyle influenced the prevalence of primary multimorbidities.",

We aimed to establish the incidence and clinical profile of post-stroke early seizure (ES) in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).\nPatients with ICH within 10 days of onset who were admitted to Landseed International Hospital were recruited consecutively between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2009. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and the modified Rankin Scale were used to access patients initial stroke severity and functional outcome at discharge, respectively. The occurrence of epileptic seizures within 30 days after onset of the index ICH was recorded. Early post-ICH seizure was defined by the occurrence of clinically identifid seizure episodes or non-epileptic seizure within 7 days after the stroke onset.\nA total of 297 ICH patients were included. The mean age of the participants was 62 &#177; 16 years, and 72% of them were male. A total of 9 (3%) participants had seizures during acute hospitalization. Patients with seizures had higher median NIHSS scores at baseline (34 vs. 16, p = 0.004). No difference was noted in the cortical involvement of ICH (22% for patients with seizures and 14% for those without, p = 0.156). Patients with seizures had higher in-hospital mortality ( 56% vs. 23%, p = 0.024). The multivariate Cox regression model showed the factors significantly associated with ES were higher initial NIHSS scores on admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.1 per 1 point increased, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-1.2) and coronary artery disease (aOR = 7.0, 95% CI = 1.3-36.4).\nThe NIHSS scores and coronary heart disease were associated with ES in ICH, whereas cortical involvement was not. These findings may reflect difference in post-stroke seizure and primary ICH between Asian and Western populations.",

        "abstract": "\nCerebrovascular diseases in Poland constitute a bigger threat to life in men than in women, especially after the age of 60. Death rates indicate higher stroke over-mortality in the rural population rather than the urban. At the same time, stroke is the main cause of long-term disability, since half of the patients are unable to independently perform daily activities, which makes them dependent on other people.\nThe study was conducted in the Independent Public Healthcare Institution in Kra&#347;nik, eastern Poland. It covered the medical records of 1,500 patients, 780 women (52%) and 720 men (48%), aged 20-100, diagnosed with cerebral infarction. The patients were hospitalised between 2011-2016 in the Neurology Ward with a Stroke Unit, the Internal Medicine Ward, and the Anaesthetics and Intensive Care Ward.\nThe stroke patients hospitalised in the Independent Public Healthcare Institution in Kra&#347;nik were residents of urban communes (59.1% of subjects) and rural communes (40.9%). The most often diagnosed type of stroke was due to embolism of the cerebral arteries (I63.4) in women (63.48%). In men, the most most often diagnosed type was cerebral infarction due to thrombosis of the cerebral arteries (I63.3; 51.33%). Stroke in 36.15% of the female subjects resulted in death. In male subjects, death occurred in 26.11% of the cases.\nWomen aged around 78-years-old were the most likely to suffer a stroke. In men, it occurred eight years earlier. Despite residents of urban areas being hospitalised due to stroke more often, deaths caused by this disease were recorded the most frequently among rural residents. It can be concluded that primary stroke prevention is the only effective measure for reducing morbidity and premature mortality in the population.",

        "abstract": "\nBeyond disruption of neuronal pathways, focal stroke lesions induce structural disintegration of distant, yet connected brain regions via retrograde neuronal degeneration. Stroke lesions alter functional brain connectivity and topology in large-scale brain networks. These changes are associated with the degree of clinical impairment and recovery. In contrast, changes of large scale, structural brain networks after stroke are less well reported. We therefore aimed to analyse the impact of focal lesions on the structural connectome after stroke based on data from diffusion-weighted imaging and probabilistic fibre tracking. In total, 17 patients (mean age 64.5&#8201;&#177;&#8201;8.4&#8201;years) with upper limb motor deficits in the chronic stage after stroke and 21 healthy participants (mean age 64.9&#8201;&#177;&#8201;10.3&#8201;years) were included. Clinical deficits were evaluated by grip strength and the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer assessment. We calculated global and local graph theoretical measures to characterize topological changes in the structural connectome. Results from our analysis demonstrated significant alterations of network topology in both ipsi- and contralesional, primarily unaffected, hemispheres after stroke. Global efficiency was significantly lower in stroke connectomes as an indicator of overall reduced capacity for information transfer between distant brain areas. Furthermore, topology of structural connectomes was shifted toward a higher degree of segregation as indicated by significantly higher values of global clustering and modularity. On a level of local network parameters, these effects were most pronounced in a subnetwork of cortico-subcortical brain regions involved in motor control. Structural changes were not significantly associated with clinical measures. We propose that the observed network changes in our patients are best explained by the disruption of inter- and intrahemispheric, long white matter fibre tracts connecting distant brain regions. Our results add novel insights on topological changes of structural large-scale brain networks in the ipsi- and contralesional hemisphere after stroke.",

Nearly 60% of intracerebral haemorrhage survivors will develop clinical manifestations of small vessel disease progression including recurrent haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke, dementia, late-life depression and gait impairment within 5&#8201;years. Blood pressure measurements following intracerebral haemorrhage are strongly associated with this risk. However, aggressive blood pressure lowering in the elderly carries substantial risks. In order to determine whether there might be an opportunity to select individuals at the highest risk for small vessel disease progression for aggressive blood pressure reduction, we investigated whether APOE gene variants &#603;2/&#603;4 modify the association between blood pressure and small vessel disease clinical progression after intracerebral haemorrhage. We conducted a single-centre longitudinal study at a tertiary care referral centre (Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, MA, USA), analysing 716 consecutive survivors of acute intracerebral haemorrhage, enrolled from January 2006 to December 2016. We conducted research interviews at the time of enrolment and obtained APOE genotypes from peripheral venous blood samples. We followed patients longitudinally by means of validated phone-based research encounters, aimed at gathering measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as information on small vessel disease clinical outcomes (including recurrent haemorrhage, incident ischaemic stroke, incident dementia, incident depression and incident gait impairment). APOE &#949;4 and systolic blood pressure were associated with the risk of recurrent haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke and post-haemorrhage dementia, depression and gait impairment (all P&#8201;<&#8201;0.05). APOE &#949;4 and systolic blood pressure interacted to increase the risk of recurrent haemorrhage, ischaemic stroke, dementia and gait impairment (all interaction P&#8201;<&#8201;0.05). Among patients with elevated blood pressure following intracerebral haemorrhage (average systolic blood pressure 120-129&#8201;mmHg and diastolic blood pressure <80&#8201;mmHg) only those with one or more APOE &#949;4 copies were at increased risk for one or more small vessel disease outcomes (hazard ratio = 1.97, 95% confidence interval 1.17-3.31). Among haemorrhage survivors with hypertension (stage 1 and beyond) APOE genotype also stratified risk for all small vessel disease outcomes. In conclusion, APOE genotype modifies the already strong association of hypertension with multiple small vessel disease clinical outcomes among intracerebral haemorrhage survivors. These data raise the possibility that genetic screening could inform blood pressure treatment goals in this patient population.",

In this review, we discuss the characteristics of SR-B1 and focus on its potential correlation with the modifiable risk factors of stroke. SR-B1 likely has an impact on stroke through its interaction with smoking, diabetes mellitus, diet, physical inactivity, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and sickle cell disease, all of which are critical risk factors in the pathogenesis of stroke.",

Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have long been the only anticoagulants available for the management of AF. Administration is complex and is one of the main causes of iatrogenic disease in the elderly. In the past 10 years, direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have emerged, and large randomised trials (RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, ARISTOTLE, ENGAGE-AF) have demonstrated their superiority over VKAs in the management of AF. These trials were conducted on large numbers of patients (n=71,683), including 27,500 patients aged &#8805;75 years and nearly 8,000 subjects aged >80 years. Results from 11 recent meta-analyses of randomised trials and observational real-world studies of 660,896 elderly patients indicate that DOACs are more effective than VKA-based prophylaxis in preventing stroke (with a reduction in risk ranging from 13% to 26%), and carry a lower risk of cerebral haemorrhaging (50% reduction in risk). The risk of major haemorrhaging appears to be similar to, or lower than that with DOACs relative to VKAs (depending on the dosage, renal function, haemorrhagic site or type of DOAC). Moreover, improved outcomes with DOACs over VKA therapy have been demonstrated based on subgroup analyses in subjects aged over 75, in patients with renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance: 30-50 mL/min) and in those with a history of falls. Analyses indicate that DOACs are a better choice than VKAs in the elderly because elderly patients are at greatest risk of stroke and cerebral haemorrhaging. In summary, DOACs have a better efficacy/tolerance profile than VKAs, which justifies their first-line use in subjects over 75 years of age.",

A system for dynamic visualisation of lower-limb movement based on 3-dimentional motion capture and a computer timed functional electrical stimulation system was developed. Participants received up to 20-min enhanced treadmill training instead of their over-ground gait training once or twice a week for 6&#8201;weeks at Coathill hospital, Lanarkshire, United Kingdom. Number of training sessions attended, and training duration were used to assess feasibility. Ankle kinematics in the sagittal plane of walking with and without functional electrical stimulation support of the pre-tibial muscles were also compared and used to confirm the functional electrical stimulation was triggered at the targeted time.\nSix patients after stroke participated in the study. The majority of participants were male (5/6) with a age range from 30 to 84&#8201;years and 4/6 had left hemiplegia.

Some studies, such as platelet transfusion versus standard care after acute stroke due to spontaneous cerebral haemorrhage associated with antiplatelet therapy (PATCH) and platelets for neonatal transfusion Study 2 (PLANET-2), have reported an increased risk of harm with platelet transfusion in specific patient groups. These studies suggest a wider role of platelets beyond hemostasis, and highlight the need for further clinical trials to better understand the risks and benefits of platelet transfusions. This review evaluates the indications for platelet transfusion, both prophylactic and therapeutic, in the light of recent studies and clinical trials.

The Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) scale is used in many languages to evaluate patients undergoing stroke rehabilitation. This study aimed to investigate the reliability and validity of the Japanese ABC scale (ABC-J) version among patients &#8805;6 months after stroke.\nThis cross-sectional study was conducted with 88 post-stroke patients (mean age 66.5&#177;9.5 years). The ABC-J was administered with the 10-meter walk test (10MWT), Timed Up and Go Test (TUG-T), Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Geriatric Depression Scale-Short version-Japanese (GDS-S-J), and the Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I). After a 1-2-week interval, the ABC-J was completed again by 69 of the patients. Reliability was investigated for reproducibility (intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC], standard error of measurement [SEM], and minimal detectable change [MDC]) and internal consistency (Cronbach's &#945;). Concurrent and convergent validities were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients.\nThe ABC-J showed excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's &#945; = 0.95) and substantial test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.92, 95% confidence interval: 0.87-0.95), with SEM and MDC of 7.14 and 19.79, respectively. The total ABC-J score was significantly correlated with 10MWT (r = -0.51, p < 0.001), TUG-T (r = -0.55, p < 0.001), BBS (r = 0.61, p < 0.001), GDS-S-J (r = -0.27, p = 0.012), and FES-I (r = -0.77, p < 0.001).\nABC-J is a valid and reliable measurement tool for investigating balance confidence among patients &#8805;6 months after stroke.",

The patients were followed up for the detection of the prevalence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in 180 days after PCI in both groups. Compared to pre-PCI, the serum hs-CRP, hs-IL-6, CK-MB, and cTnI levels were increased at 24 h after PCI (all p < 0.05) in both groups. However, change in the levels of hs-CRP and hs-IL-6 were significant (p = 0.04 and p = 0.02, respectively). Changes in the levels of CK-MB and cTnI were non-significant (p = 0.15 and p = 0.39, respectively). No MACE (death, Q wave MI, target vessel revascularization, ischemic stroke) was detected in any patient in any group during a 3-month follow-up. Administration of calcitriol in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes undergoing elective PCI can attenuate the increase in serum inflammatory biomarkers in the serum (hs-CRP and hs-IL-6) and thus decrease the inflammatory reaction caused by PCI.",

        "abstract": "\nStroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) remain leading causes of mortality and morbidity globally. Although mortality rates have been in decline, the number of people affected by stroke has risen. These patients have a range of long-term needs and often present to primary care. Furthermore, many of these patients have multimorbidities which increase the complexity of their healthcare. Long-term impacts from stroke/TIA along with care needs for other morbidities can be challenging to address because care can involve different healthcare professionals, both specialist and generalist. In the ideal model of care, such professionals would work collaboratively to provide care. Despite the commonality of multimorbidity in stroke/TIA, gaps in the literature remain, particularly limited knowledge of pairings or clusters of comorbid conditions and the extent to which these are interrelated. Moreover, integrated care practices are less well understood and remain variable in practice. This article argues that it is important to understand (through research) patterns of multimorbidity, including number, common clusters and types of comorbidities, and current interprofessional practice to inform future directions to improve long-term care.",

Generative adversarial networks (GAN) inspired architectures have recently gained popularity in medical image segmentation with one of them being SegAN, a novel end-to-end adversarial neural network architecture. In this paper, we investigate SegAN with three different types of U-Net inspired architectures for left ventricle segmentation from cardiac MRI data. We performed our experiments on the 2017 ACDC segmentation challenge dataset. Our results show that the performance of U-Net architectures is better when trained in the SegAN framework than when trained stand-alone.

Anoxia, defined as the lack of oxygen, is commonly seen in both these pathologies and triggers profound metabolic and cellular changes. Sphingolipids have been implicated in anoxia injury, but the pathomechanism is unknown. Here we show that anoxia-associated injury causes accumulation of the non-canonical sphingolipid 1-deoxydihydroceramide (DoxDHCer). Anoxia causes an imbalance between serine and alanine resulting in a switch from normal serine-derived sphinganine biosynthesis to non-canonical alanine-derived 1-deoxysphinganine. 1-Deoxysphinganine is incorporated into DoxDHCer, which impairs actin folding via the cytosolic chaperonin TRiC, leading to growth arrest in yeast, increased cell death upon anoxia-reoxygenation in worms and ischaemia-reperfusion injury in mouse hearts. Prevention of DoxDHCer accumulation in worms and in mouse hearts resulted in decreased anoxia-induced injury. These findings unravel key metabolic changes during oxygen deprivation and point to novel strategies to avoid tissue damage and death.",

        "abstract": "\nAssessing the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) accurately requires 3D volumetric data of the LV. Cardiologists either have no access to 3D ultrasound (US) systems or prefer to visually estimate LVEF based on 2D US images. To facilitate the consistent estimation of the end-diastolic and end-systolic blood pool volume and LVEF based on 3D data without extensive complicated manual input, we propose a statistical shape model (SSM) based on 13 key anchor points-the LV apex (1), mitral valve hinges (6), and the midpoints of the endocardial contours (6)-identified from the LV endocardial contour of the tri-plane 2D US images. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the principle modes of variation needed to represent the LV shapes, which enables us to estimate an incoming LV as a linear combination of the principle components (PC). For a new, incoming patient image, its 13 anchor points are projected onto the PC space; its shape is compared to each LV shape in the SSM based on Mahalanobis distance, which is normalized with respect to the LV size, as well as direct vector distance (i.e., PCA distance), without any size normalization. These distances are used to determine the weight each training shape in the SSM contributes to the description of the new patient LV shape. Finally, the new patient's LV systolic and diastolic volumes are estimated as the weighted average of the training volumes in the SSM. To assess our proposed method, we compared the SSM-based estimates of diastolic, systolic, stroke volumes, and LVEF with those computed directly from 16 tri-plane 2D US imaging datasets using the GE Echo-Pac PC clinical platform. The estimated LVEF based on Mahalanobis distance and PCA distance were within 6.8% and 1.7% of the reference LVEF computed using the GE Echo-Pac PC clinical platform.",

The prevalence of parents and caregivers leaving children unattended in enclosed vehicles is non-negligible.\nThis paper aims to assess parents' knowledge and beliefs about vehicular heat strokes among children in addition to the prevalence and associated factors of leaving children inside locked cars.\nA cross-sectional study was carried out at King Abdullah Specialist Children's Hospital in Riyadh. Two hundred nine parents completed a self-administered questionnaire addressing vehicular heat strokes.\nAmong the participants, 24.88% have left at least one of their children unattended inside locked cars during a sunny day; 78.85% of parents have heard about accidental deaths secondary to leaving children in locked vehicles. When assessing parental knowledge of increased sensitivity to heat in infants/children, 81.34% of them knew the correct information. Older age (P&#160;= .0150), less paternal education (P&#160;= .0157), and increased number of children (P&#160;= .0020) were associated with increased incidences of leaving children unattended in enclosed cars.\nConsidering the high temperatures in the Gulf region, the prevalence of vehicular heat stroke secondary to locking children inside vehicles is nontrivial.

The study was conducted to evaluate the clinical efficacy of tenecteplase versus reteplase through network meta-analysis for AMI. Randomized trials were comprehensively searched in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane library, and Web of Science using appropriate strategies. Quality assessment was done for the papers. The primary and secondary end-points were mortality, TIMI grade 3 flow at 90 min, death or non-fatal stroke, infarction, total stroke and major bleeding. Odds ratios (OR) were computed (95% confidence intervals). After screening 27325 records, eight articles were included with total patients of 49875 to the meta-analysis. Indirect comparison of tenecteplase vs. reteplase showed no significant differences in the risk of mortality (OR = 0.98, p > 0.05), TIMI grade 3 flow at 90 min (OR = 0.77, p > 0.05), death or non-fatal stroke (OR = 1.04, p > 0.05), infarction (OR = 1.11, p > 0.05), total stroke (OR = 2.71, p > 0.05), and major bleeding (OR = 0.81, p > 0.05) (all p > 0.05). Indirect comparison suggests similar efficacy and safety of tenecteplase and reteplase.

The prognostic meaning of anaemia and polyglobulia on outcomes in patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis is ambiguous.\nIn this prospective multicentre, intravenous thrombolysis register-based study, we compared haemoglobin levels on hospital admission with three-month poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale 3-6), mortality and symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II-criteria (ECASS-II-criteria)). Haemoglobin level was used as continuous and categorical variable distinguishing anaemia (female: <12&#160;g/dl; male: <13&#160;g/dl) and polyglobulia (female: >15.5&#160;g/dl; male: >17&#160;g/dl). Anaemia was subdivided into mild and moderate/severe (female/male: <11&#160;g/dl). Normal haemoglobin level (female: 12.0-15.5&#160;g/dl, male: 13.0-17.0&#160;g/dl) served as reference group. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated with logistic regression models.\nAmong 6866 intravenous thrombolysis-treated stroke patients, 5448 (79.3%) had normal haemoglobin level, 1232 (17.9%) anaemia - of those 903 (13.2%) had mild and 329 (4.8%) moderate/severe anaemia - and 186 (2.7%) polyglobulia. Anaemia was associated with poor outcome (ORadjusted 1.25 (1.05-1.48)) and mortality (ORadjusted 1.58 (1.27-1.95)). In anaemia subgroups, both mild and moderate/severe anaemia independently predicted poor outcome (ORadjusted 1.29 (1.07-1.55) and 1.48 (1.09-2.02)) and mortality (ORadjusted 1.45 (1.15-1.84) and ORadjusted 2.00 (1.46-2.75)). Each haemoglobin level decrease by 1&#8201;g/dl independently increased the risk of poor outcome (ORadjusted 1.07 (1.02-1.11)) and mortality (ORadjusted 1.08 (1.02-1.15)). Anaemia was not associated with occurrence of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. Polyglobulia did not change any outcome.\nThe more severe the anaemia, the higher the probability of poor outcome and death. Severe anaemia might be a target for interventions in hyperacute stroke.\nAnaemia on admission, but not polyglobulia, is a strong and independent predictor of poor outcome and mortality in intravenous thrombolysis-treated stroke patients.",

Patient-specific implant selection and insertion processes are keys to the success of the procedure, yet subjective in nature. A population study of the angle of entry at the interatrial septum relative to the appendage can assist in both catheter design and patient-specific implant choice. In our population study, we analyzed the inherent clusters of the angles that were obtained between the septum normal and the LAA ostium plane. The number of inherent angle clusters matched the LAA four morphological classifications reported in the literature. Further, our exploratory analysis revealed that the normal from the ostium plane does not intersect the septum in all the samples under study. The insights gained from this study can help assist in making objective decisions during LAA closure.",

An underappreciated aspect however is its sensitivity to contributions from autonomic physiology that may affect CBF through changes in vascular resistance and blood pressure. As is reviewed here, this is crucial to consider in fMRI studies of sleep, given the close linkage between the regulation of arousal state and autonomic physiology. Typical methods for separating these effects are based on the use of reference signals that may include physiological parameters such as heart rate and respiration; however, the use of time-invariant models may not be adequate due to the possibly changing relationship between reference and fMRI signals with arousal state. In addition, recent research indicates that additional physiological reference signals may be needed to accurately describe changes in systemic physiology, including sympathetic indicators such as finger skin vascular tone and blood pressure.",

Platelets are sensitive to the haemodynamic environment. Rapid haemodynamcis and disturbed blood flow, which occur in vessels with growing thrombi and atherosclerotic plaques or is caused by medical device implantation and intervention, promotes platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. In such situations, conventional antiplatelet drugs often have suboptimal efficacy and a serious side effect of excessive bleeding. Investigating the mechanisms of platelet biomechanical activation provides insights distinct from the classic views of agonist-stimulated platelet thrombus formation. In this work, we review the recent discoveries underlying haemodynamic force-reinforced platelet binding and mechanosensing primarily mediated by three platelet receptors: glycoprotein Ib (GPIb), glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) and glycoprotein VI (GPVI), and their implications for development of antithrombotic 'mechano-medicine' .",

All subjects were divided into 2 groups: 1st group - 25 patients with community - acquired pneumonia (mean age 49&#177;18 years) without concomitant pathology of the cardiovascular system and 2nd group - 18 patients with community - acquired pneumonia (mean age 70.1&#177;11 years) with concomitant cardiovascular disease.\nThe main ultrasound parameters did not differ from the normal values in patients from the 1st group. In patients from the 2nd group there was a significant deterioration of several pulmonary - cardiac hemodynamics parameters, decrease of left ventricular ejection fraction, significant myocardial hypertrophy of the left ventricle and left atrium size increase. Regarding the right heart chambers it was revealed dilatation of the right ventricle, increasing of the estimated systolic pressure in the right ventricle, deterioration of right ventricle myocardial diastolic function, increase of the: RV/LV size ratio, LV eccentricity index, RV myocardium thickness, diameter of the pulmonary artery, velocity of pulmonary regurgitation and the area right atrium size. In addition, the amplitude of systolic displacement of the tricuspid valve ring and the intensity of inspiratory collapse of the inferior vena cava decreased. Correlation analysis of clinical and laboratory parameters, which are markers of endogenous intoxication, oxygen saturation of arterial blood (SpO2), separately for two groups of patients with community - acquired pneumonia, showed a reliable correlation with a number of informative and used in the practice echocardiography parameters of pulmonary cardiac hemodynamics, characterizing systolic (systolic movement amplitude of the tricuspid valve ring - TAPSE), as well as diastolic function (E/A of the right ventricle) of the heart.\nThe relationship between the severity of pulmonary - cardiac hemodynamics disturbances in patients with community - acquired pneumonia, having comorbid pathology, contributing to the deterioration of pulmonary - cardiac hemodynamics and more severe course of the disease with markers of the inflammatory process and oxygen saturation of arterial blood decrease is revealed.",

        "abstract": "\nClinical guidelines for management of non-valvular atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism currently recommend direct oral anticoagulants as the preferred strategy for antithrombotic treatment. As a result, they are increasingly being used as an alternative to conventional therapy. However, they are unlikely to completely replace conventional approaches, due to a number of existing medical challenges. These challenges relate to the uncertainty of optimal dose regimens and the strategy of using them in specific patient populations with non-valvular atrial fibrillation or venous thromboembolism. The efficacy and safety profile of dabigatran among various regions may differ, depending on regional variations in dosing recommendations. Furthermore, optimal dose regimens may be different between Asian and non-Asian populations. It will be necessary to collect real-world clinical data on the use of edoxaban in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation with high-creatinine clearances, to determine the optimal dose required for stroke protection. In addition, the efficacy of combination therapy utilizing direct oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents has not yet been established in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation with acute coronary syndrome and/or percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting. Low-molecular-weight heparin is, therefore, suggested to be used in preference to vitamin K antagonists or direct oral anticoagulants in current clinical practice guidelines, as indirect comparisons suggests that oral anticoagulants are less effective than low-molecular-weight heparin. Consequently, we need to focus on the outcomes of ongoing studies and review more real-world data in heterogeneous populations to complement clinical data obtained from controlled studies with highly selective populations. Therefore, direct oral anticoagulants should be used with caution based on individual assessments of thromboembolic and bleeding risks as well as other clinical characteristics.",

This study assessed the value of strain compared with currently used parameters as predictor for heart failure-free survival in patients with sRV.\nIn participants of a multicentre trial, speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) was performed to assess global longitudinal strain (GLS), mechanical dispersion (MD), and postsystolic shortening (PSS). Cox regression was used to determine the association of STE parameters with the combined end point of progression of heart failure and death, compared with cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and computed tomography (CT) derived parameters.\nEchocardiograms of 60 patients were analyzed (mean age 34&#160;&#177; 11 years, 65% male, 35% congenitally corrected TGA). Mean GLS was&#160;-13.5 &#177; 2.9%, median MD was 49 (interquartile range [IQR] 30-76) ms, and 14 patients (23%) had PSS. During a median 8 (IQR 7-9) years, 15 patients (25%) met the end point. GLS, MD, and PSS were all associated with heart failure-free survival in univariable analysis. After correction for age, only GLS (optimal cutoff >&#160;-10.5%) and CMR/CT-derived sRV ejection fraction (optimal cutoff < 30%) remained associated with heart failure-free survival: hazard ratio (HR) 8.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.50-27.41 (P < 0.001), and HR 4.34, 95% CI 1.48-12.74 (P&#160;= 0.007), respectively). Combining GLS and ejection fraction improved prediction, with patients with both GLS >&#160;-10.5% and sRV ejection fraction < 30% at highest risk (HR 19.69, 95% CI 4.90-79.13; P < 0.001).\nThe predictive value of GLS was similar to that of CMR/CT-derived ejection fraction. The combination of GLS and ejection fraction identified patients at highest risk of heart failure and death.

Our goal was to identify drivers of health care costs in TAVR.\nDemographics, procedural details, in-hospital complications, and costs for all adults undergoing first-time TAVR from 2012 to 2016 in Ontario, Canada, were obtained through linkages of clinical/administrative databases. Total costs included were from initial referral to the first of either death or 1-year post-TAVR. Phase-based costing was performed to empirically estimate the presence, duration, and cost per patient for each phase up to 1 year or death. Multivariable regression was used to identify drivers of cost accumulation per phase.\nWe identified 2009 first-time TAVR patients (mean age 81.7&#160;&#177; 7.6, 45.9% female and Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score of 7.2 &#177; 5.8). Phases of cost were identified with an early high-cost period within 60 days of referral, a second phase from the procedure to 60 days, and a stable phase from 60 to 360 days postprocedure. The referral phase median cost was $4527 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1708-12,594), the procedure to 60 days phase median cost was $29,518 (IQR: 24,842-40,279), and the post 60-day stable phase median cost was $6053 (IQR: 3320-17,048). Predictors of higher cost in the referral phase were in-hospital wait location, dialysis dependence, and heart-failure status. In the second (procedural) phase, predictors were nontransfemoral access, complications of stroke, and pacemaker insertion. Predictors of higher cost in the third (stable) phase were predominantly nonmodifiable, such as frailty.\nThis analysis shows that there are 3 distinct phases of cost accumulation from referral to post-TAVR with some potentially modifiable cost drivers in each phase.",

Current prognostic scores, including the MICH, are based on the assessment of baseline patient characteristics, failing to account for significant developments, such as intraventricular extension and clinical deterioration, which may occur over the first 72 hours. We propose to validate the MICH in all hemorrhage locations and hypothesize that its calculation at 72 hours will outperform its baseline counterpart with respect to predicting mortality and functional outcome. We performed a retrospective analysis of collated data from the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive database. Primary outcome was 90-day mortality. Secondary outcome was poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale 4-6) at 90 days. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated looking at the predictive ability of the MICH score for mortality and poor outcome, at baseline and at 72 hours. Competing curves were assessed with nonparametric methods. A total of 226 patients were included, with a 90-day mortality of 22.5%. The MICH scores calculated at 72 hours were more predictive of mortality than at baseline (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.89 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-0.94] vs 0.78 [95% CI: 0.70-0.85]), P < .01. The MICH scores at 72 hours similarly better predicted functional outcome (AUC: 0.78 [95% CI: 0.72-0.84] vs AUC: 0.72 [95% CI: 0.66-0.78]), P = .047. The MICH score has positive prognostic value for mortality and poor functional outcome in all hemorrhage locations. Delaying its calculation resulted in higher predictive values for both and suggests that delaying discussions around withdrawal of care may result in more accurate prognostication in acute intracerebral hemorrhage.",

These innate adaptations are of significance particularly to organs that are highly susceptible to energy deprivation, such as the brain and the heart. Among vertebrates, the arctic ground squirrel (AGS) is a species that tolerates ischemic/anoxic insult. During the process of entering hibernation, a state of prolonged torpor, the AGS undergoes a profound decrease in respiratory rate, heart rate, blood flow, cerebral perfusion, and body temperature (Tb). The reduced level of blood flow during torpor resembles an ischemic state, albeit without energy deficit. During the process of arousal or emergence from torpor, however, when Tb, respiratory rate, heart rate, and blood flow rapidly returns to pre-torpid levels, the rapid return of cerebral blood flow mimics aspects of reperfusion such as is seen after stroke or cardiac arrest. This sublethal ischemic/reperfusion insult experienced by AGS during the process of arousal may precondition AGS to tolerate otherwise lethal ischemic/reperfusion injury induced in the laboratory. In this review, we will summarize some of the mechanisms implemented by mammalian hibernators to combat ischemia/anoxia tolerance.",

The aim of this systematic review was to explore and synthesise available literature on ultrasound measurement of brain tissue motion in humans.\nOur systematic review was designed to include predefined study selection criteria, quality evaluation, and a data extraction pro-forma, registered prospectively on PROSPERO (CRD42018114117). The systematic review was conducted by two independent reviewers.\nTen studies were eligible for the evidence synthesis and qualitative evaluation. All eligible studies confirmed that brain tissue motion over the cardiac cycle could be measured using ultrasound; however, data acquisition, analysis, and outcomes varied. The majority of studies used tissue pulsatility imaging, with the right temporal window as the acquisition point. Currently available literature is largely exploratory, with measurements of brain tissue displacement over a narrow range of health conditions and ages. Explored health conditions include orthostatic hypotension and depression.\nFurther studies are needed to assess variability in brain tissue motion estimates across larger cohorts of healthy subjects and in patients with various medical conditions. This would be important for informing sample size estimates to ensure future studies are appropriately powered. Future research would also benefit from a consistent framework for data analysis and reporting, to facilitate comparative research and meta-analysis.

Unweighted data of IP and ambulatory encounters from the 2014 NHCS are linked to records from the 2014 and 2015 National Death Index (NDI). Methods-For the 2014 NHCS, 94 hospitals provided IP administrative claims data and 88 provided ambulatory (emergency and outpatient department) claims data. Although these data are not nationally representative, the survey provides unique opportunities to study health conditions such as stroke, because all IP discharges and ambulatory encounters from participating hospitals are collected for a 12-month period. The collection of patient identifiers (e.g., patient name, Social Security number, and date of birth) allows for linkage to outside data sources such as NDI, providing information on patient mortality after hospital discharge. Analyses examined stroke encounters across various hospital settings. Results-Approximately two-thirds of stroke IP discharges originated from hospital emergency departments. IP visits for stroke tended to originate from the IP department among younger patients, and from the emergency department for older patients. The likelihood of postdischarge mortality was higher for stroke patients aged 85 and over. Thirteen percent of stroke patients aged 85 and over died within 30 days of an IP discharge compared with almost 6% of stroke patients aged 75-84. This study highlights the unique analytical capabilities of NHCS.",

It results in significant clinical-radiological dissociation and introduces bias in research trials. The purpose of the study is to review and compare angiographic anatomy with microsurgical anatomy literature of the MCA with emphasis on the discrepancy.\nConsecutive cerebral angiograms between January 2011 and March 2014 were retrospectively reviewed by endovascular surgical neuroradiologists. Information about the anatomy of the sphenoidal segment of the MCA classified as classic and non-classic pattern, the lenticulostriate artery takeoff pattern, and the course angulation of the sphenoidal segment were studied.\nA total of 500 patients, 886 cerebral angiograms, were reviewed. We found the classic pattern of the main trunk MCA bifurcation and a straight angulation course in less than half of the cases. The lenticulostriate arteries arose not only from the main trunk but also from its divisions in more than half of the cases.\nIt is important to corroborate our findings and to develop a pragmatic classification to accurately assess MCA occlusions from the radiological and clinical perspective.",

        "abstract": "\nRecent reports have raised various concerns about the risk of vessel wall injury while withdrawing current laser-cut stent retrievers during active strut apposition to the vessel walls. The development of braided thrombectomy assist devices in conjunction with aspiration systems may be gentler on the fragile brain vessels and more optimized with regard to the radial force (RF) for vessel diameters of proximal (M1) and distal (M2) large vessel occlusions (LVOs).\nMechanical bench testing of the RF was performed using a radial compression station mounted on a tensile testing machine. The total RF in newtons (N) generated in vessels with diameters ranging from 2.25 to 3 mm as seen in proximal LVOs (&#8764;M1), and in vessel diameters ranging from 1.5 to 2.24 mm as seen in distal LVOs (&#8764;M2), was measured. The outer diameter of each stent was recorded, and an RF &#8804;1 N was grouped as \"low,\" while an RF >1 N was grouped as \"high\" for this analysis.\nThe total RFs of all laser-cut stent retrievers were all higher in the simulated M2 vessels (>1 N) than in the M1 vessels (<1 N), whereas the total RFs of the braided thrombectomy assist devices were uniformly low in both the simulated M1 and the simulated M2 vessels.\nNovel braided thrombectomy assist devices in conjunction with aspiration systems have lower RFs than existing laser-cut stent retrievers in M1 and M2 vessel diameters. Further in vivo studies are needed to delineate the impact of lowering the RF on vessel wall integrity.",

We reviewed clinical and radiographic data during a 36-month period. Primary outcome was clinical evidence of ipsilateral stroke in the first 30 days. Secondary outcomes include clinical outcomes and sonographic and/or angiographic follow-up over 6 months, 6-month functional scale, and all-cause mortality.\nFifty-five patients underwent CAS using flow reversal: 26 females and 29 males with a mean age of 69.7 years. Median time to treatment from index event was 3 days. 11% underwent stenting as part of hyperacute stroke therapy. Average luminal stenosis was 86%. The 9-Fr Mo.Ma device was used in combination with Penumbra aspiration in all cases. There were no ipsilateral strokes. Incidence of any ischemic event was 3.64%, but only 1 (1.82%) patient had a postoperative stroke. Clinical follow-up was available for 94.5%, while lesion follow-up was available for 73% of patients. Three patients had evidence of restenosis, but none were symptomatic. Luminal restenosis was &#8804;30% in all three.

Therefore, the effect of stent retriever length on FPS for fibrin-rich clots was investigated by using SolitaireTM 6 &#215; 40 versus 6 &#215; 30 mm devices with a balloon guide catheter (BGC) or distal access catheter (DAC) and sheath, in an in vitro model of anterior circulation neurovascular anatomy. Additionally, vascular safety of the SolitaireTM 6 &#215; 40 versus 6 &#215; 30 mm devices was evaluated in a porcine model for differences in: luminal thrombus, inflammation, endothelial coverage, fibrin deposits, smooth muscle cell loss, elastic lamina and adventitia disruption, intimal hyperplasia, and lumen reduction, at 0, 30, and 90 days post-treatment. In vitro overall FPS was measured as: SolitaireTM 6 &#215; 40 (95%) and SolitaireTM 6 &#215; 30 (67%). FPS for clot location in middle cerebral artery was: (a) BGC (6 &#215; 40 mm: 100%; 6 &#215; 30 mm: 100%; n = 8); (b) DAC with 088 sheath (6 &#215; 40 mm: 83%; 6 &#215; 30 mm: 33%; n = 12).

The patients were divided based on the device utilized. Multivariate analysis of associations between devices (stent retriever or aspiration only [manual or pump aspiration system]) was performed. Primary outcomes were good recanalization (i.e., modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score &#8805;2b) and a favorable modified Rankin scale (mRS) score (i.e. &#8804;2). The secondary outcome was symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH).\nA total of 197 AIS patients underwent MCA M2 ELVO thrombectomy with either a stent retriever (n = 120) or aspiration only (n = 77). The aspiration-only group utilized either manual (n = 38) or pump aspiration (n = 39). Utilization of a stent retriever over manual aspiration is independently associated with higher odds of a favorable mRS score (OR = 3.2; 95% CI 1.02-9.7) and lower odds of sICH (OR = 0.09; 95% CI 0.03-0.31). Utilization of a stent retriever over a pump aspiration system is independently associated with higher odds of good recanalization (OR = 3.8; 95% CI 1.5-9.6).

However, radiographic reperfusion does not always translate into good clinical outcomes even if the reperfusion occurs early after the stroke onset. Reasons for neurological worsening (NW) are thought to be many, such as progression of the stroke, hemorrhagic conversion post tissue plasminogen activator and/or EVT, and procedural complications such as vessel dissection or perforation, distal emboli, and re-occlusion. Data on patients worsening in the acute phase after EVT are limited.\nWe studied the factors associated with acute NW and also identified the predictors of NW after EVT and its association with poor outcome at discharge.\nA retrospective cohort from a single comprehensive stroke center includes patients with acute ischemic stroke and large vessel occlusion in anterior and posterior circulation who presented between December 2014 and May 2017 and received EVT were reviewed. Primary outcome was defined as acute NW defined as change in NIHSS &#8805;4 from baseline in the first 24 h after EVT. Secondary outcome were modified Rankin scale (mRS) 0-2 at discharge and final infarct volume. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate clinical and radiographic variables independently correlating with NW after EVT. Receiver operating curve analysis was also performed to identify predictors.\n178 patients were included in the analysis, 26 (14.7%) met the criteria for acute NW. For these 178 patients, the median age was 63 (IQR 53-74, range 26-89), baseline median NIHSS was 19 (IQR 14-24, range 5-37), ASPECTS was 8 (IQR 7-9, range 4-10), admission median systolic blood pressure (SBP) was 150 (IQR 131-170, range 94-287), and initial median blood glucose (BG) was 123 (IQR 106-157, range 69-433). The most common reasons for worsening were progression of the stroke (42.3%) and reperfusion injury PH-2 (26.9%) (p < 0.0001). Univariate logistic analysis showed that race, ASPECTS, collateral score, diabetes mellitus, admission SBP, and admission BG were associated with acute NW. In multivariate analysis, only admission BG (OR 1.00, CI 1.00-1.01, p = 0.04) was found to have a significant association with acute NW. We ran a prediction analysis for variables and found the area under the curve to be 0.75. Finally, there was strong association between NW and poor outcome at discharge (MRS 3-6, p < 0.01) by Fisher's exact test. About 46.1% in the NW group died during hospitalization compared to 10% in the non-NW group (p < 0.0001).\nOur single-center retrospective cohort result is limited by small sample size.

In the past decade, several studies have investigated the phenomenon, commonly known as the obesity paradox, with mixed results thus far. We sought to determine whether outcomes differ between patients with large vessel occlusion strokes (LVOS) after endovascular therapy (ET) according to their body mass index (BMI).\nWe reviewed our prospectively collected endovascular database at a tertiary care academic institution. All patients that underwent ET for acute LVOS were categorized according to their BMI into 4 groups: (1) underweight (BMI < 18.5), (2) normal weight (BMI = 18.5-25), (3) overweight (BMI = 25-30), and (4) obese (BMI > 30). Baseline characteristics, procedural radiological as well as outcome parameters where compared.\nA total of 926 patients qualified for the study, of which 20 (2.2%) were underweight, 253 (27.3%) had a normal weight, 315 (34%) were overweight, and 338 (36.5%) were obese. When compared with normal weight (reference), overweight patients were younger, had higher rates of dyslipidemia and diabetes and higher glucose levels, while obese patients were younger, less often smokers, and had higher rates of hypertension and diabetes and higher glucose levels. Other baseline and procedural characteristics were comparable. The rates of successful reperfusion (modified treatment in cerebral ischemia, 2b-3), parenchymal hematomas, 90-day good clinical outcomes (modified Rankin scale, 0-2), and 90-day mortality were comparable between groups. On multivariate analysis, BMI was not associated with good outcomes nor mortality.\nIn patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy, BMI is not associated with outcomes.

        "abstract": "\nThe most dangerous atherosclerotic plaques, referred to as \"vulnerable,\" are most likely to trigger acute atherothrombotic events such as myocardial infarction (heart attack) and stroke. Our goal was to uncover the molecular drivers of vulnerable plaque formation.\nTo elucidate the functional gene modules that drive vulnerable plaque formation, we performed a weighted gene coexpression network analysis integrated with a protein-protein interaction network analysis in human atherosclerotic carotid samples, which identified the candidate gene granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor 2 (GM-CSF) receptor alpha subunit (CSF2RA). Follow-up in&#160;vitro experiments were performed to elucidate the regulatory relationship between CSF2RA and the microRNA miR-532-3p as well as modifiers of macrophagic miR-532-3p-CSF2RA axis expression. Microarray and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) studies elucidated the effect of statins on carotid miR-532-3p-CSF2RA axis expression in patients with carotid atherosclerotic disease. Apoe-/-, Ldlr-/-, and Csf2ra mutant Apoe-/- mouse models of atherosclerosis were employed to assess the effects of agomiR-532-3p therapy in&#160;vivo.\nThe integrated weighted gene coexpression network analysis/protein-protein interaction network analysis revealed that the macrophagic GM-CSF receptor CSF2RA is significantly upregulated in macrophage-rich vulnerable plaques. Follow-up analysis identified the miR-532-3p-CSF2RA axis, as miR-532-3p downregulates CSF2RA via binding to CSF2RA's 3'UTR. Macrophagic miR-532-3p-CSF2RA dysregulation was enhanced via modified low-density lipoprotein or tumor necrosis factor &#945; exposure in&#160;vitro. Moreover, this miR-532-3p-CSF2RA dysregulation was observed in human vulnerable plaques and Apoe-/- mouse plaques, effects rescued by statin therapy. In&#160;vivo, agomiR-532-3p therapy suppressed murine plaque formation and promoted plaque stabilization in a Csf2ra-dependent manner.\nMacrophagic miR-532-3p-CSF2RA axis dysregulation is a key driver in vulnerable plaque formation.",

        "abstract": "\nManagement of acute stroke varies greatly within and between different countries. This study assesses the current practices of physicians in Lebanon routinely involved in ischemic stroke (IS) management. We conducted a prospective observational study of patients hospitalized at 8 different Lebanese hospitals in the period August 1, 2015 to July 31, 2016, with a diagnosis of acute stroke. Baseline characteristics and data on diagnostic studies, as well as treatments received during hospitalization and at discharge, were collected and analyzed. Two hundred and three strokes/transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) were recorded but only 173 patients (85%) with ischemic events were included in the study. The patients' mean age was 69.8&#177;12.7 years. All underwent brain imaging (CT scan and/or MRI) on admission. All ISs were managed by a neurologist, and patient management included consultation of a cardiologist. Hypertension was the most prevalent risk factor (78.6%), followed by a current cigarette smoking habit (50.3%), diabetes mellitus (42.8%), hypercholesterolemia (39.9%), previous stroke or TIA (17.3%), and atrial fibrillation (14.7%). Only four patients (accounting for 2.5% of the ISs) received thrombolytic therapy. More than 89% of the patients were discharged on at least one anti-hypertensive drug, 89.2% on statins and 37.6% on antidiabetic medications. More than 55% of patients were dependent at discharge, as shown by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2, whereas 33% were independent (mRS score of 3-5). There are many challenges facing stroke care in Lebanon, and there is potential for improvement in this setting. Reperfusion therapy is still largely underused and remains a major challenge in achieving guideline-based reperfusion goals.",

This study examines whether real-time three-dimensional volume ICE guidance (4D volume ICE) can be used as an alternative to TEE during LAA closure (LAAC).\nFifteen patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), who had high risk for stroke and contraindication for long-term warfarin therapy, were enrolled in the study. The WATCHMAN device was used for transcatheter LAAC under fluoroscopy. LAA and device sizing was performed using TEE and volume ICE guidance from the right heart. Intraprocedural ICE measurements were consistent with TEE; LAA maximal width and depth, and maximal diameter of the implanted device were moderately correlated (Pearson's coefficient: 0.63, 0.65, and 0.71 respectively; p<0.05) with good agreement (bias: -0.03 cm, -0.07 cm, and 0.003 cm respectively). The average imaging success rate, defined by the number of patients with all the required intraprocedural measurements, was 67% for ICE and 100% for TEE. The WATCHMAN device was successfully implanted in all patients with a device to patient ratio of 1.33.\n4D volume ICE can be used as an intraprocedural sizing and guidance tool for transcatheter LAAC with measurements comparable to TEE. Challenging patient characteristics significantly degrade the diagnostic image quality when imaging from the right heart. Standardized workflow with proper patient selection and optimal preprocedural planning may improve the diagnostic quality of volume ICE guidance for transcatheter LAAC procedure.",

While treating Hemophiliacs with AF, deciding eligibility, choosing the anticoagulant based on risk-benefit ratio are tough decisions for physicians to make. This review paper aims to explore and compare existing studies, reviews and consensus papers to assess the safety of different Novel Oral Anticoagulants (NOACS) in this population.\nThorough literature search was conducted on Pubmed using Atrial Fibrillation, Hemophilia A, Oral anticoagulants, stroke prevention, Dabigatran, factor Xa inhibitors as keywords separately and in combinations. Papers in English language only from the past 5 years were selected for review. After removing duplicate results, 80 papers were selected and after applying different exclusion criteria and according to relevance, 40 papers were finalized for review.\nThe keywords AF, Stroke prevention, oral anticoagulants, Hemophilia a, Factor Xa inhibitors and Dabigatran gave 24899, 13619, 8964, 3503, 2850, 2799 results, respectively. Combination keywords also showed some papers and out of short-listed 80 relevant papers 35 were finalized. Reviewing and analyzing these papers revealed no clinical trials in hemophiliacs with AF in the past 5 years and 5 clinical trials comparing NOACs with Warfarin in general population. Rest were systematic reviews, consensus papers and meta-analyses on management in this group. A few compared these drugs for AF in the general population but not specifically in Hemophiliacs and others. consensus papers developed suggestions for management and showed that NOACs are superior to Warfarin but need individual evaluation in Hemophiliacs with AF.\nPatients with Hemophilia can also have thrombo-embolism despite their bleeding tendency and NOACs are a better option in them because of less need for monitoring, no food interactions and fewer drug interactions. This comparative review emphasized the need for more work to develop proper guidelines for thrombo-prophylaxis management in this specific group.",

Although 3D ultrasound measurement of total plaque volume (TPV) showed the efficacy of high-dose statin, more sensitive biomarkers are needed to establish the efficacy of dietary supplements expected to confer a smaller beneficial effect. This study involved 171 subjects who participated in a one-year placebo-controlled trial evaluating the effect of pomegranate. A framework involving a feature selection technique known as discriminative feature selection (DFS) and a semi-supervised graph-based regression (SSGBR) technique was proposed for sensitive detection of plaque textural changes over the trial. 376 textual features of plaques were extracted from 3D ultrasound images acquired at baseline and a follow-up session. A scalar biomarker for each subject were generated by SSGBR based on prominent textural features selected by DFS. The ability of this biomarker for discriminating pomegranate from placebo subjects was quantified by the p-values obtained in Mann-Whitney U test. The discriminative power of SSGBR was compared with global and local dimensionality reduction techniques, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), maximum margin criterion (MMC) and Laplacian Eigenmap (LE). Only SSGBR (p=4.12&#215;10-6) and normalized LE (p=0.002) detected a difference between the two groups at the 5% significance level. As compared with &#916;TPV, SSGBR reduced the sample size required to establish a significant difference by a factor of 60. The application of this framework will substantially reduce the cost incurred in clinical trials.",

ICH is a common cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Aggressive surgical treatment for ICH has remained controversial as clinical trials have failed to demonstrate substantial improvement in patient outcome and mortality. Recently, promising mechanical and pharmacological minimally invasive surgery (MIS) techniques for the treatment of ICH have been described. MIS was designed with the objective of reducing morbidity due to complications of surgical manipulation. Mechanical MIS includes the use of tubular retractors and small diameter instruments for ICH removal. Pharmacological methods consist of catheter placement inside the haematoma cavity for the passive drainage of the haematoma over the course of several days. One of the most favourable approaches for MIS is the use of natural corridors for reaching the lesion, such as the transsulcal parafascicular approach. This approach provides an anatomical dissection of the subjacent white matter tracts, causing the least amount of damage while evacuating the haematoma. A detailed description of the currently known MIS techniques and devices is presented in this review. Special attention is given to the transsulcal parafascicular approach, which has particular benefits to provide a less traumatic MIS with promising overall patient outcome.",

A Randomized trial of Unruptured Brain Arteriovenous Malformations (ARUBA) was the first trial conducted to compare the effects of medical and interventional therapy. Although it concluded that medical therapy was superior in preventing stroke and death over a follow-up period of 33 months, the findings were met with intense criticism regarding several aspects of study design, progression, and analysis/conclusion. Namely, the increased use of stand-alone embolisation relative to microsurgery in a cohort with predominantly low-grade lesions combined with a short follow-up period amplified treatment risk. Subsequently, several observational studies were conducted on ARUBA-eligible patients to investigate the safety and efficacy of microsurgery, radiosurgery, and endovascular embolisation over longer follow-up periods. These reports showed that favourable safety profiles and cure rates can be achieved with appropriate patient selection and judicious use of different treatment modalities in multidisciplinary centres. Since large prospective randomised trials on AVMs may not be feasible, it is important to make use of practice-based data beyond the flawed ARUBA study to optimise patients' lifetime outcomes.",

All participants were separated into two groups: anti-hyperuricemia and control groups (without anti-hyperuricemia treatment). Comparisons of prevalent CVD including coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke and heart failure were made and the associations of anti-hyperuricemia treatment and prevalent CVD were analyzed.\nCompared to the anti-hyperuricemia group, patients in the control group had significantly higher serum C-reactive protein (10.6 &#177;2.8 vs. 7.4 &#177;1.2 mg/dl) and uric acid (UA) levels (438 &#177;33 vs. 379 &#177;64 &#181;mol/l), and were more likely to receive &#946;-blockers (34.2% vs. 31.1%) and calcium channel blockers (49.2% vs. 43.4%). The prevalence of ischemic stroke was higher in the control group (15.8% vs. 11.3%). Compared to other groups, blood pressure was significantly higher in patients in the 4th quartile serum UA level group. In the unadjusted model, anti-hyperuricemia treatment was significantly associated with a reduced odds ratio (OR) of composite CVD. After adjusting for potential covariates, OR of anti-hyperuricemia treatment for composite CVD was 0.89 with a 95% confidence interval (IC) of 0.82-0.98. Associations of anti-hyperuricemia treatment and ischemic stroke were also significant with OR = 0.93 and 95% CI: 0.88-0.99, while associations of anti-hyperuricemia with coronary heart disease and heart failure attenuated into insignificance after adjusting for covariates.\nIn hypertensive patients with hyperuricemia, anti-hyperuricemia treatment was associated with lower odds of prevalent CVD.",

The migraine group was composed of patients from the Gebze Fatih Community Hospital (Kocaeli, Turkey) neurology outpatient service and the control group included hospital staff and friends who volunteered to participate. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Migraine was designated as a dependent variable. Family history of migraine, stroke, metabolic syndrome, cardiac disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus; cigarette use; alcohol consumption; and the presence of hypertension, IR, hypertriglyceridemia, low level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), central obesity, metabolic syndrome; as well as homeostasis model assessment and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index results were selected as independent variables.\nThe mean waist circumference, mean height, mean weight, and central obesity were greater in the control group (p=0.009, 0.004, 0.036, and 0.015, respectively). A multivariate logistic regression model of migraine presence showed that a family history of migraine (odds ratio [OR]: 1.542, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.451-8.905; p<0.0001), family history of stroke (OR: 1.043, 95% CI: 1.214-6.633; p=0.016), and no central obesity (OR: -0.705, 95% CI: -0.290-0.843; p=0.010) were statistically significant variables in our study.\nThe results of our study indicated that IR and metabolic syndrome were not associated with migraine in women.

Differences in the timing of assessment, stroke type, comorbid medical conditions, and stroke complications may have contributed to this large variability. This study is conducted to investigate the prevalence of malnutrition, and its associated risk factors in stroke patients admitted to our stroke clinic.\nA prospective design was used to measure the nutritional status and nutritional risk of stroke patients during hospitalisation between June 2016 and February 2017. Nutritional status was measured at admission. Demographic data and information on clinical variables were collected, which included the patient's age, gender, type of stroke and other comorbid disorders. Blood samples, including concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), serum albumin, serum creatinine, lipid profile and serum lymphocyte count, were measured by routine methods. Nutritional status was measured using the Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA); for elderly stroke patients (age older than 65). For stroke patients younger than 65 age, Nutrition Screening 2002 (NRS 2002) was used.\n318 patients with acute stroke were assessed for their nutritional status at admission. There were 145 (45%) female and 173 (55%) male patients. Their mean age was 66.16&#177;14.32. 66.1% of the patients elder than 65 years were malnourished. 12.2% of the patients younger than 65 years were found to be malnourished. We found no relationship between comorbidities and malnutrition, except hyperlipidemia. Nourished stroke patients older than 65 years had higher serum lipid levels than the malnourished patients. We also found no relationship between malnutrition biomarkers and being malnourished.\nMalnutrition is frequently observed in patients with stroke. Early recognition of malnutrition is crucial, but the absence of valid markers hampers to find out the presence of malnutrition. Thus, further research is needed in targeting the modifiable nutrition risk factors and give attention to nutrition in stroke patients.",

        "abstract": "\nConcomitant diseases in elderly individuals with diabetes (renal failure, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, stroke, urinary incontinence, cognitive impairment, dementia, sarcopenia, and osteoporosis) make diabetes management difficult. Therefore, other comorbid conditions should be taken into account in elderly diabetics when considering a treatment approach. The use of oral antidiabetic agents in individuals older than 75 years may be limited. Although the diabetes treatment is not any different in healthy elderly patients, hypoglycemia is one of the most feared conditions, especially in the elderly. Therefore, metformin, DPP-IV inhibitors, and SGLT2 inhibitors should be considered in the first place with less risk of hypoglycemia. Low-dose sulfonylureas may also be used in selected cases. The use of new antidiabetic drugs, such as GLP-1 anologues and SGLT2 inhibitors, has strengthened our ability to cope with the risk of hypoglycemia and cardiovascular events, which are the two most important drawbacks in the treatment of elderly people with diabetes. Insulin treatment should be individualized, and the most rare injection regimens should be used. In case of failure of OAD, basal insulin should be added to the current treatment, and if necessary, a basal + plus regimen should be planned by adding bolus insulin 1/2/3 times per day to the meals. As a result, in elderly diabetics, an inadequate treatment or excessive treatment and individualizing the treatment should be the most appropriate approach.",

A multidisciplinary team developed and implemented an ICU Transfer Checklist that contained a synthesis of the patient's clinical course, immediate \"to-do\" action items, and a system-based review of active medical problems. Postintervention checklist utilization was recorded for 8 months, and quality metrics for the postintervention cohort were compared to the preintervention cohort. Providers were surveyed pre- and postintervention to characterize perceived workflow and quality of care.\nPatients before (n = 52) and after (n = 81) ICU Transfer Checklist implementation had similar demographic and clinical characteristics. In the postchecklist implementation period, the ICU Transfer Checklist was used in over 85% of patients and median hospital length of stay (LOS) decreased (8.6 days vs 5.4 days, P = .003), while ICU readmission rate remained low.

        "abstract": "\nGlobally, stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). The red cell distribution width (RDW) is a readily available and inexpensive test which is done routinely as a part of complete blood count in these patients.\nIn this study, we tried to correlate the RDW with severity of acute ischemic stroke (AIS).\nPatients presenting to emergency department (ED) within 24 hours of the onset of clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of AIS were assessed for Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score followed by non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) scan. RDW value for all the patients who were included in the study were co-related with the severity of the stroke.\nThe median (IQR) RDW in the patients with minor stroke on the basis of GCS was 13.5 (13.3-13.5), moderate stroke was 13.8 (13.5-14.4) and with severe stroke was 15.4 (15.1-15.6) (p < 0.001). The median (IQR) RDW in the patients with minor stroke on the basis of NIHSS score was 13.4 (13.2 - 13.6), moderate stroke was 13.8 (13.5-14.3), and moderate to severe stroke was 14.7 (14.5-15.3) and with severe stroke was 15.5 (15.1-15.7) (p < 0.001). The median RDW in patients who were alive was 13.8 (13.5-15.1) and in patients who expired was 15.5 (14.5-15.7) (p = 0.048).\nBased on the findings of this study, RDW index has statistically significant correlation with the severity of AIS. So it can potentially be an important parameter to predict the prognosis of AIS patients.",

A collapsed 5-category rating scale was superior to the 101-category scale. The hardest item was \"walking outside on an icy sidewalk,\" the easiest item was \"getting into or out of a car,\" and no items misfit. The ABC scale had high person reliability (0.93), despite 10.5% of individuals misfitting the expected response pattern. Mean ability level of the sample was slightly lower (-0.56 logits) than the mean item difficulty indicating that the ABC scale adequately matched our sample's balance confidence. The ABC scale did not have a floor or ceiling effect and separated individuals into 5 statistically distinct strata (separation index = 3.71).\nThe Rasch model supports the use of the ABC scale to measure balance confidence in individuals poststroke. The consistency of our results with previous Rasch analyses on the ABC scale demonstrates the instrument responds similarly across multiple populations; community-dwelling older-adults, outpatient orthopedic physical therapy, stroke, Parkinson disease, and lower-limb amputation. Recommendations include collapsing the rating scale and developing a computerized-adaptive test version of the scale to enhance clinical utility.",

We performed propensity matching between the dual-eligible and non-dual-eligible cohorts. Postintervention use, including imaging, amputation and death, was determined using Medicare claims data.\nRates of major amputation were higher among dual-eligible patients (13.0% vs 10.5%, p<0.001), while time to amputation by disease severity was similar (p=0.443). For patients with more advanced disease (critical limb ischaemia (CLI) vs claudication), dual-eligible patients have significantly faster times to any amputation and death (p<0.001). For of postoperative imaging, 48.4% of dual-eligible patients receive at least one postoperative image, while the percentage for non-dual-eligible patients is 47.2% (p=0.187).\nPatients with mild forms of peripheral artery disease (PAD), such as claudication, demonstrated similar outcomes regardless of dual-eligibility status. However, those with severe PAD, such as CLI, who were also dual-eligible had both inferior overall survival and amputation-free survival. Minimal differences were observed in process-driven aspects of care between dual-eligible and non-dual-eligible patients, including postoperative imaging. These findings indicate that despite receiving similar care, dual-eligible patients with severe PAD have inferior long-term outcomes, suggesting the Medicaid safety net is not timely enough to benefit from long-term outcomes for these patients.",

        "abstract": "\nThe crystalline lens and cornea comprise the eye's optical system for focusing light in human vision. The changes in biomechanical properties of the lens and cornea are closely associated with common diseases, including presbyopia and cataract. Currently, most in vivo elasticity studies of the anterior eye focus on the measurement of the cornea, while lens measurement remains challenging. To better understand the anterior segment of the eye, we developed an optical coherence elastography system utilizing acoustic radiation force excitation to simultaneously assess the elasticities of the crystalline lens and the cornea in vivo. A swept light source was integrated into the system to provide an enhanced imaging range that covers both the lens and the cornea. Additionally, the oblique imaging approach combined with orthogonal excitation also improved the image quality. The system was tested through first ex vivo and then in vivo experiments using a rabbit model. The elasticities of corneal and lens tissue in an excised normal whole-globe and a cold cataract model were measured to reveal that cataractous lenses have a higher Young's modulus. Simultaneous in vivo elasticity measurements of the lens and cornea were performed in a rabbit model to demonstrate the correlations between elasticity and intraocular pressure and between elasticity and age. To the best of our knowledge, we demonstrated the first in vivo elasticity of imaging of both the lens and cornea using acoustic radiation force-optical coherence elastography, thereby providing a potential powerful clinical tool to advance ophthalmic research in disorders affecting the lens and the cornea.",

Experiments were conducted on two healthy subjects with normal walking and with hip circumduction and foot drop, the latter to mimic hemiparetic gait post-stroke.\nUnlike the foot switches, the pressure sensor yielded data during swing. The initial swing and terminal stance readings followed local foot-shoe dynamics and were thus able to detect foot drop swing deficits while also providing push-off information during stance.\nThe analog pressure sensors provided more information than foot switches, even during stance.

Instead, time consuming and subjective assessments are used. However, many brain and physiologic variables are measured continuously in neurological ICU, and could be used as indicators for consciousness. Since many biological variables are highly correlated to maintain homeostasis, we examine whether changes in time lags between correlated variables may relate to changes in consciousness. We introduce new methods to identify changes in the time lag of correlations, which better handle noisy multimodal physiological data and fluctuating lags. On neurological ICU data from subarachnoid hemorrhage patients, we find that correlations among variables related to brain physiology or respiration have significantly longer lags inpatients with decreased levels of consciousness than in patients with higher levels of consciousness. This suggests that physiological data could potentially be used to automatically assess consciousness.",

We sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan versus enalapril in patients with HFREF in the contemporary Australian setting.\nWe developed a Markov model with two health states ('Alive' and 'Dead') to assess the cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan versus enalapril in patients with HFREF. Model subjects were 63 years of age at entry and had simulated follow-up over 20 years. Transition probabilities were derived from the Prospective comparison of ARNI with ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and morbidity in Heart Failure (PARADIGM-HF) study. Costs and utility data were derived from published sources. All costs and effects were discounted at an annual rate of 5% and are presented in Australian dollars. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to test variability in key data inputs.\nIn the base-case analysis, sacubitril/valsartan was found to reduce non-fatal heart failure hospitalisations and cardiovascular deaths, with numbers-needed-to-treat over a 20-year period of 40 and 27, respectively. The use of sacubitril/valsartan led to an additional 6 months of life gained per patient, translating to A$27,954 per years of life saved (YoLS) and A$40,513 per quality-adjusted-life-years (QALY) gained. The results of the sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were robust.\nOur analysis supports switching HFREF patients on ACE inhibitor or ARB to sacubitril/valsartan.",

Management of CVD in older patients may be challenging due to specific geriatric issues, such as frailty and multi-morbidity, which may influence patients' outcomes. In this clinical context, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies should target those outcomes that have higher priority in geriatric health care, including disability prevention and quality of life. Older adults with CVD should be offered a reasonably optimized treatment, customized to the individual's frailty level and functional status. Yet, most clinical trials excluded comorbid and frail patients and evidence to support CVD management in this vulnerable population is lacking. Therefore, a geriatric approach is needed in cardiovascular medicine, characterized by a holistic, patient-centered perspective focusing on functional status and quality of life. With a view to promote the geriatric approach in the management of older patients with CVD, the EuGMS Special Interest Group (SIG) on Cardiovascular Medicine was founded in 2018, consisting of a network of geriatricians with an extensive expertise in geriatric cardiovascular medicine.

Compared with patients aged <65 years, older age (&#8805;65&#8201;years) was associated with greater use of antithrombotic drugs in stroke [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) (95% confidence interval)&#8201;=&#8201;2.83 (1.04-7.73) for patients aged (75-84 years)] and less use of RAS blockers [aOR&#8201;=&#8201;0.39 (0.16-0.89) for patients aged &#8805;85 years], &#946;-blockers [aOR&#8201;=&#8201;0.31 (0.19-0.53) for patients aged 75-84 years] and lipid-lowering therapy [aOR&#8201;=&#8201;0.39 (0.15-1.02) for patients aged &#8805;85 years, P for trend&#8201;=&#8201;0.01] in CAD. Older age was not associated with less use of antiplatelet agents in CAD or oral anticoagulants in atrial fibrillation.\nIn patients with CKD, older age per se was not associated with the underuse of antithrombotic drugs but was for other major drugs, with a potential impact on cardiovascular outcomes.",

        "abstract": "\nMammalian cells have many quality-control mechanisms that regulate protein-coding gene expression to ensure proper transcript synthesis, processing, and translation. Should a step in transcript metabolism fail to fulfill requisite spatial, temporal, or structural criteria, including the proper acquisition of RNA-binding proteins, then that step will halt, fail to proceed to the next step, and ultimately result in transcript degradation. Quality-control mechanisms constitute a continuum of processes that initiate in the nucleus and extend to the cytoplasm. Here, we present published and unpublished data for protein-coding genes whose expression is activated by the transcriptional coactivator PGC-1&#945;. We show that PGC-1&#945; movement from chromatin, to which it is recruited by DNA-binding proteins, to CBP80 at the 5' cap of nascent transcripts begins a series of co- and posttranscriptional quality- and quantity-control steps that, in total, ensure proper gene expression.",

        "abstract": "\nNon-invasive brain stimulation is being increasingly used to interrogate neurophysiology and modulate brain function. Despite the high scientific and therapeutic potential of non-invasive brain stimulation, experience in the developing brain has been limited.\nTo determine the safety and tolerability of non-invasive neurostimulation in children across diverse modalities of stimulation and pediatric populations.\nA non-invasive brain stimulation program was established in 2008&#160;at our pediatric, academic institution. Multi-disciplinary neurophysiological studies included single- and paired-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) methods. Motor mapping employed robotic TMS. Interventional trials included repetitive TMS (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Standardized safety and tolerability measures were completed prospectively by all participants.\nOver 10 years, 384 children underwent brain stimulation (median 13 years, range 0.8-18.0). Populations included typical development (n&#160;=&#160;118), perinatal stroke/cerebral palsy (n&#160;=&#160;101), mild traumatic brain injury (n&#160;=&#160;121) neuropsychiatric disorders (n&#160;=&#160;37), and other (n&#160;=&#160;7). No serious adverse events occurred. Drop-outs were rare (<1%). No seizures were reported despite >100 participants having brain injuries and/or epilepsy. Tolerability between single and paired-pulse TMS (542340 stimulations) and rTMS (3.0 million stimulations) was comparable and favourable. TMS-related headache was more common in perinatal stroke (40%) than healthy participants (13%) but was mild and self-limiting. Tolerability improved over time with side-effect frequency decreasing by >50%. Robotic TMS motor mapping was well-tolerated though neck pain was more common than with manual TMS (33% vs 3%). Across 612 tDCS sessions including 92 children, tolerability was favourable with mild itching/tingling reported in 37%.\nStandard non-invasive brain stimulation paradigms are safe and well-tolerated in children and should be considered minimal risk. Advancement of applications in the developing brain are warranted. A new and improved pediatric NIBS safety and tolerability form is included.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune and inflammatory disease that affects the joints and consequently leads to the destruction of cartilage and bone lesions. Traditionally, ginger has been consumed in treatment of osteoarthritis, joint and muscle pain, neurological diseases, and inflammation of gums, tooth pain, asthma, stroke, diabetes, and constipation. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of ginger on some immunological and inflammatory markers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: In this study, which was performed during 2013-2016, 66 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who referred to the rheumatology clinic at Shariati hospital were en-rolled. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: one group consumed 1.5 gr ginger per day, and the other group took roasted wheat flour (placebo), respectively. To determine the effect of confounding factors on the findings of the study, questionnaires for nutrient intake, physical activity, and medication were filled, and BMI was measured. For each participant, at the beginning and end of the study, Serum hs-CRP and mRNA levels of IL-1&#946;, IL-2 and TNF-&#945; were determined by ELISA and Quantitative Real Time PCR, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. Significance level was set at p<0.05. Results: Results of the study showed ginger powder supplementation caused a significant decline in CRP (p=0.050) and IL-1&#946; mRNA level (p=0.021). TNF&#945; mRNA levels reduced in ginger group compared to placebo groupalthough the difference was not significant between the 2 groups (p=0.093). Ginger had no effects on IL2 gene expression. Conclusion: This study showed that ginger reduces inflammatory factors hs-CRP and IL-1&#946; gene expression in patients with active RA and it seems that ginger can improve the inflam-mation in the patients.",

        "abstract": "\nNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a systemic disorder with a complex multifactorial pathogenesis and heterogenous clinical manifestations. NAFLD, once believed to be an innocuous condition, has now become the most common cause of chronic liver disease in many countries worldwide. NAFLD is already highly prevalent in the general population, and owing to a rising incidence of obesity and diabetes mellitus, the incidence of NAFLD and its impact on global healthcare are expected to increase in the future. A subset of patients with NAFLD develops progressive liver disease leading to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure. NAFLD has emerged as one of the leading causes of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in recent years. Moreover, HCC can occur in NAFLD even in absence of cirrhosis. Compared with the general population, NAFLD increases the risk of liver-related, cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. NAFLD is bidirectionally associated with metabolic syndrome. NAFLD increases the risk and contributes to aggravation of the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. In addition, NAFLD is linked to colorectal polyps, polycystic ovarian syndrome, osteoporosis, obstructive sleep apnea, stroke, and various extrahepatic malignancies. Extended resection of steatotic liver is associated with increased risk of liver failure and mortality. There is an increasing trend of NAFLD-related cirrhosis requiring liver transplantation, and the recurrence of NAFLD in such patients is almost universal. This review discusses the growing burden of NAFLD, its outcomes, and adverse associations with various diseases.",

Despite the high medical need, few research efforts have addressed the impact of cytotoxic agents on cognition (ie, postchemotherapy cognitive impairment; PCCI). One unsolved question is whether individual cytotoxic drugs have differential effects on cognition. We thus examine the current state of research regarding PCCI. Neurological symptoms after targeted therapies and immunotherapies are not part of this review.\nA literature search was conducted in the PubMed database, and 1215 articles were reviewed for predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Thirty articles were included in the systematic review.\nTwenty-five of the included studies report significant cognitive impairment. Of these, 21 studies investigated patients with breast cancer. Patients mainly received combinations of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and taxanes (FEC/FEC-T). Five studies found no significant cognitive impairment in chemotherapy patients. Of these, 2 studies investigated patients with colon cancer receiving 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX). Independent risk factors for PCCI were patient age, mood alterations, cognitive reserve, and the presence of apolipoprotein E e4 alleles.\nThere is evidence that certain chemotherapy regimens cause PCCI more frequently than others as evidenced by 21 out of 23 studies in breast cancer patients (mainly FEC-T), whereas 2 out of 3 studies with colon cancer patients (FOLFOX) did not observe significant changes. Further studies are needed defining patient cohorts by treatment protocol in addition to cancer type to elucidate the effects of individual cytotoxic drugs on cognitive functions.",

Although PAWP typically correlates with right atrial pressure (RAP), it is primarily dependent on left-heart myocardial properties and volume status. As right-heart disease can occur in the absence of left-heart disease in patients with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), we hypothesized that RAP was the primary determinant of PAWP in this population.\nA cohort study of adults with TOF that underwent right-heart catheterization at Mayo Clinic Rochester (1990 to 2017) to determine the relationship among RAP, PAWP, and mortality.\nAmong 213 patients (male 105; age 37 &#177; 14 years), the mean PAWP was 14 &#177; 5 mm Hg, and RAP was 11 &#177; 5 mm Hg. RAP was the strongest predictor of PAWP (&#946;&#160;= 0.68, standard error&#160;= 0.06, P < 0.001), independent of left-heart disease and atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk factors.

PAWP was an independent predictor of death/transplant (hazard ration [HR] 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.20, P =&#160;0.004). However, when RAP was incorporated into the regression model, RAP (and not PAWP) became the independent predictor of outcomes (HR 1.14, 95% CI, 1.06-1.22, P&#160;= 0.001).\nThe current study showed that RAP was the primary determinant of PAWP and accounts, to some extent, for the mortality in patients with TOF and high PAWP.

The results showed that compared with conventional treatment alone,Wenxin Granules combined with conventional treatment can better reduce the BNP level in patients with heart failure with atrial fibrillation( MD =-258. 18,95% CI[-464. 06,-52. 30],P= 0. 01) or NT-proBNP level,better improve left ventricular ejection fraction( MD = 6. 72,95%CI[4. 61,8. 84],P&lt;0. 000 01),I~2= 65%,And the ventricular rate decreased more significantly( MD =-11. 66,95% CI[-15. 79,-7. 54],P&lt;0. 000 01),and the cardiac function was improved more efficiently( RR = 1. 20,95%CI [1. 11,1. 31],P&lt;0. 000 1),I~2= 23%.In conclusion,compared with the single administration of conventional Western medicine,the combined administration of Wenxin Granules has better effects in reducing the level of BNP or NT-proBNP,slowing down the ventricular rate,and improving the left ventricular ejection fraction,with fewer adverse reactions. However,due to the small sample size and the low quality of literatures included in this systematic review,it is shall be carefully applied in clinic. More rigorous randomized controlled trials shall be conducted to determine the efficacy of Wenxin Granules in improving cardiac function in the treatment of chronic heart failure with atrial fibrillation.",

The mechanisms underlying ischemic stroke are still not completely understood. the present study identified 19 lncRNAs related to stroke recovery by analyzing a public dataset GSE37587. A co-expression network included 24 lncRNAs, 1668 mRNAs and 3542 edges were constructed in the present study. Bioinformatics analysis showed these lncRNAs were involved in regulating multiple biological processes and pathways, such as mRNA nonsense-mediated decay, translation, cell-cell adhesion. Three lncRNAs, including DLEU1, LOC432369, and LOC338799, were identified as key lncRNAs in stroke. Bioinformatics showed DLEU1 was involved in regulating oxidative phosphorylation, and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. LOC432369 was associated with oxidative phosphorylation. LOC338799 was associated with clathrin-dependent endocytosis, the establishment of organelle localization and ribonucleoprotein complex assembly. We thought this study could provide useful information to understand the mechanisms underlying stroke progression.",

        "abstract": "\nTherapeutic hypothermia (TH) is an approved neuroproctetive treatment to reduce neurological morbidity and mortality after hypoxic-ischemic damage related to cardiac arrest and neonatal asphyxia. Also in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS), which in Western countries still shows a very high mortality rate of about 25 %, selective mild TH by means of Targeted Temperature Management (TTM) could potentially decrease final infarct volume. In this respect, a novel intracarotid blood cooling catheter system has recently been developed, which allows for combined carotid blood cooling and mechanical thrombectomy (MT) and aims at selective mild TH in the affected ischemic brain (core and penumbra). Unfortunately, so far direct measurement and control of cooled cerebral temperature requires invasive or elaborate MRI-assisted measurements. Computational modeling provides unique opportunities to predict the resulting cerebral temperatures on the other hand. In this work, a simplified 3D brain model was generated and coupled with a 1D hemodynamics model to predict spatio-temporal cerebral temperature profiles using finite element modeling. Cerebral blood and tissue temperatures as well as the systemic temperature were analyzed for physiological conditions as well as for a middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 occlusion. Furthermore, vessel recanalization and its effect on cerebral temperature was analyzed. The results show a significant influence of collateral flow on the cooling effect and are in accordance with experimental data in animals. Our model predicted a possible neuroprotective temperature decrease of 2.5 &#8451; for the territory of MCA perfusion after 60 min of blood cooling, which underlines the potential of the new device and the use of TTM in case of AIS.",

The present study aimed to investigate associations between imaging markers of lesion-related and generalised brain pathology and the development of PSA and PSD during a one-year follow-up.\nIn a prospective cohort study, 188 stroke patients received 3-Tesla MRI at baseline (three months post-stroke) for evaluation of lesion-related, vascular, and degenerative brain pathology. Presence of lacunes, microbleeds, white matter hyperintensities, and enlarged perivascular spaces was summed to provide a measure of total cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) burden (range 0-4). The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and Apathy Evaluation Scale were administered at baseline and repeated at 6- and 12-month follow-up to define presence of PSD and PSA, respectively.\nPopulation-averaged logistic regression models showed that global brain atrophy and severe cSVD burden (score 3-4) were significantly associated with the odds of having PSA (ORGEE 5.33, 95% CI 1.99-14.25 and 3.04, 95% CI 1.20-7.69, respectively), independent of stroke lesion volume and co-morbid PSD.

We constructed pedigrees for all families with &#8805;2 first-degree relatives with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage or unruptured intracranial aneurysms. The proband was defined as the first family member with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage who sought medical attention. We compared both the proportion of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and unruptured intracranial aneurysms in proband's first-degree relatives by calculating relative risks (RR) with children as the reference.\nWe studied 154 families with 1,105 first-degree relatives of whom 146 had aneurysmalsubarachnoid hemorrhage. Unruptured intracranial aneurysms were identified in 63 (19%) of the 326 screened relatives. Siblings had a higher risk of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (RR:1.62, 95% CI:1.12-2.38) and parents a lower risk (RR:0.44, 95% CI:0.24-0.81) than children.

Using adjusted logistic and Cox regression, we assessed the association of imaging measures with clinical outcome including recurrent ischaemic stroke, intracranial haemorrhage and death and assessed disability (modified Rankin Scale).\nOverall, recurrent ischaemic stroke was more common than intracranial haemorrhage (22 versus 8, respectively). Cerebral microbleeds were related to an increased risk of the composite endpoint (ischaemic stroke, intracranial haemorrhage, death: odds ratio (OR) 2.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27-3.31; P&#8201;=&#8201;0.003), as were white matter hyperintensities (OR 2.00, 95%CI 1.23-3.27, P&#8201;=&#8201;0.005).

Validity of administrative coding has varied in previous studies, but little is known about the temporal trends of coding accuracy, which could bias analyses.\nUsing all incident and recurrent strokes in a population-based cohort (Oxford Vascular Study/OXVASC) with multiple sources of ascertainment as the reference, we determined the temporal trends in sensitivity and positive predictive value of hospital diagnostic codes for identifying acute stroke from 2002 to 2017.\nOf 1883 hospitalised strokes, 1341 (71.2%) were correctly identified by coding. Sensitivity of coding improved over time for all strokes (ptrend&#8201;=&#8201;0.005) and for incident cases (ptrend&#8201;=&#8201;0.002). Of 1995 apparent stroke admissions identified by International Classification of Disease-10 stroke codes (I60-I68), 1588 (79.6%) used the stroke-specific codes (I60-I61/I63-I64). Positive predictive value was higher with the use of specific codes (83.2% vs. 69.2% for all codes) and highest if combined with the first admission only (88.5%), particularly during more recent time periods (2014-2017&#8201;=&#8201;90.3%).

Haemorrhagic transformation occurred in 30.2% of patients. Pooled sensitivity and specificity were 85.9% (95% CI; 65-97%), 73.9% (95% CI; 45-92%) and accuracy of 79.1% (95% CI; 57-98%). Pooled NPV was 92.9% with a high false positive rate (19.8%), which could be explained in terms of outcome classification, acquisition artefact and computed tomography perfusion processing algorithms.\nThis review evaluated the importance of using pre-defined threshold measurement for optimal prediction of HT, the relevance of patient pre-treatment clinical parameters to HT occurrence, the CTP parameters and the measurements that are independent predictors of HT, the significance of rtPA rather as an exacerbator of HT and the impact of both minor and major HT/PH on patient 20 functional outcome.\nComputed tomography perfusion has a high sensitivity and moderately high specificity for prediction of haemorrhagic transformation in acute ischaemic stroke. Pre-treatment clinical decision making requires consideration of clinical factors in addition to imaging findings. This systematic review and meta-analysis highlights that pre-treatment computed tomography perfusion adds to clinical confidence by predicting potential for haemorrhage, both in thrombolysed and un-thrombolysed patients, and also influences decisions about alternative treatments for acute ischaemic stroke patients.",

        "title": "Homeostatic activity regulation as a mechanism underlying the effect of brain stimulation.",
        "abstract": "\nHyperexcitability of the neural network often occurs after brain injuries or degeneration and is a key pathophysiological feature in certain neurological diseases such as epilepsy, neuropathic pain, and tinnitus. Although the standard approach of pharmacological treatments is to directly suppress the hyperexcitability through reducing excitation or enhancing inhibition, different techniques for stimulating brain activity are often used to treat refractory neurological conditions. However, it is unclear why stimulating brain activity would be effective for controlling hyperexcitability. Recent studies suggest that the pathogenesis in these disorders exhibits a transition from an initial activity loss after acute injury or progressive neurodegeneration to subsequent development of hyperexcitability. This process mimics homeostatic activity regulation and may contribute to developing network hyperexcitability that underlies neurological symptoms. This hypothesis also predicts that stimulating brain activity should be effective in reducing hyperexcitability due to homeostatic activity regulation and in relieving symptoms. Here we review current evidence of homeostatic plasticity in the development of hyperexcitability in some neurological diseases and the effects of brain stimulation. The homeostatic plasticity hypothesis may provide new insights into the pathophysiology of neurological diseases and may guide the use of brain stimulation techniques for treating them.",

Standard-of-care treatments such as botulinum toxin injections can temporarily relieve muscle stiffness and pain associated with spasticity, but often at the expense of increased muscle weakness. Recent preclinical investigations of a non-invasive treatment that pairs trans-spinal direct current stimulation and peripheral nerve direct current stimulation (tsDCS+pDCS) provided promising data for a novel approach based on bioelectronic medicine for the treatment of patients with post-stroke spasticity.\nTwenty-six patients with upper limb hemiparesis and wrist spasticity at least 6&#8201;months after their initial stroke participated in this single-blind crossover design study to test whether tsDCS+pDCS reduces chronic upper-extremity spasticity. Subjects received five consecutive daily sessions (20&#8201;min of stimulation or sham) of anodal tsDCS+pDCS, separated by a one-week washout period. The sham condition always preceded the active condition. Clinical and objective measures of spasticity and motor function were collected before and after each condition, and for five weeks after the completion of the active intervention.\nSubjects treated with active tsDCS+pDCS demonstrated significant reductions in both Modified Tardieu Scale scores (summed across the upper limb, P&#8201;<&#8201;0.05), and in objective torque measures (Nm) of the spastic catch response at the wrist flexor (P&#8201;<&#8201;0.05), compared to the sham condition. Motor function also improved significantly (measured by the Fugl-Meyer and Wolf Motor Function Test; P&#8201;<&#8201;0.05 for both tests) after active treatment.\ntsDCS+pDCS intervention alone significantly reduced upper limb spasticity in participants with stroke. Decreased spasticity was persistent for five weeks after treatment, and was accompanied by improved motor function even though patients were unsupervised and there was no prescribed activity or training during that interval.\nNCT03080454, March 15, 2017.",

Established RLS was diagnosed according to the criteria of the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group (IRLSSG) in 2012. Neurological functions were assessed according to the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). The lesion location was evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The associations between the lesion location and post-stroke RLS were then analyzed by logistic regression.\nA total of 49 patients (13.03%) had RLS. The multivariate logistic regression model adjusting for post-stroke RLS risk factors including gender, age, history of hypertension, history of diabetes, history of stroke, smoking, drinking, body mass index (BMI), NIHSS, hemoglobin, platelet and homocysteine determined that body of caudate nucleus and pontine were significantly associated with post-stroke RLS with odds ratio (OR) of 26.26 (95% confidence interval (CI): 9.41-73.28,p&#160;<&#160;0.001) and OR of 4.37 (95% CI: 1.24-15.34, p&#160;=&#160;0.021). The stepwise logistic regression model with temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe, frontal lobe, callosum, body of caudate nucleus, thalamus, lenticulo capsule, corona radiata, centrum semi-ovale and pontine as potential predictors yielded a predictor mode.

        "abstract": "\nMotor imagery (MI) is a mental representation of motor behavior and has been widely used in electroencephalogram based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of MI-based BCI-feedback training in post-stroke rehabilitation. However, in the earliest stage of the training, calibration data typically contain insufficient discriminability, resulting in unreliable feedback, which may decrease subjects' motivation and even hinder their training. To improve the performance in the early stages of MI training, a novel hybrid BCI paradigm based on MI and P300 is proposed in this study. In this paradigm, subjects are instructed to imagine writing the Chinese character following the flash order of the desired Chinese character displayed on the screen. The event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) phenomenon is produced with writing based on one's imagination. Simultaneously, the P300 potential is evoked by the flash of each stroke. Moreover, a fusion method of P300 and MI classification is proposed, in which unreliable P300 classifications are corrected by reliable MI classifications. Twelve healthy na&#239;ve MI subjects participated in this study. Results demonstrated that the proposed hybrid BCI paradigm yielded significantly better performance than the single-modality BCI paradigm. The recognition accuracy of the fusion method is significantly higher than that of P300 (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.05) and MI (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.01). Moreover, the training data size can be reduced through fusion of these two modalities.",

Data Sources: A literature search was conducted using PubMed with the terms \"Yosprala,\" \"PA8140,\" and \"PA32540\" from the initial year through May, 2019. Additional sources were gathered through bibliographies. Aralez Pharmaceuticals Inc was contacted for manufacturer information. Study Selection and Data Extraction: The sources were narrowed to studies done in English language between 1990 and 2019. All viable clinical trials for the use of Yosprala in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events were included. Data Synthesis: Yosprala is a coordinated delivery system of immediate-release omeprazole 40 mg and enteric-coated aspirin (325 mg or 81 mg). In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration approved Yosprala for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events (ie, stroke or myocardial infarction). While it is recommended that patients take low-dose aspirin for secondary prevention of these events, many patients cannot tolerate the gastrointestinal (GI) adverse effect profile of the drug. Phase 3 clinical trials have proven that Yosprala significantly lowers the occurrence of GI bleeds and ulcers versus aspirin alone (3.2% and 8.6%, respectively; P &#8804; .001). The most common adverse effects include infection, diarrhea, and dyspepsia. Conclusion: Yosprala significantly reduces the occurrence of GI ulcers and seems to be a safe and effective option for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.",

The purposes of the present study were the comparisons of two groups of PAthl, one with SCI and the other with either amputation (AMP) or post poliomyelitis syndrome (PM), assessing the (1) peak cardiorespiratory responses and determinants (SV and HR) of CO during maximal and submaximal arm cranking exercise (ACE), respectively; (2) correlations between peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) and the highest SV obtained during submaximal exercise; and (3) correlations between oxygen pulse (O2 pulse, ratio between VO2 and HR) and both SV and O2 arterio-venous difference [(a-v)O2diff]. Each athlete (19 PAthl with SCI, 9 with AMP, and 5 with PM) completed a continuous incremental cardiopulmonary ACE test to volitional fatigue to assess peak responses. In a different session, CO was indirectly measured through carbon dioxide (CO2) rebreathing method at sub-maximal exercise intensities approximating 30, 50, and 70% of the VO2peak. There were no significant differences between the PAthl groups in age, anthropometry, and VO2peak. However, peak HR was significantly lower, and peak O2 pulse was significantly higher in PAthl with AMP/PM compared to those with SCI. During sub-maximal exercise, PAthl with AMP/PM displayed significantly higher SV values (154.8 &#177; 17.60 ml) than PAthl with SCI (117.1 &#177; 24.66 ml). SV correlated significantly with VO2peak in both PAthl with SCI (R 2 = 0.796) and AMP/PM (R 2 = 0.824). O2 pulse correlated significantly with SV in both PAthl with SCI (R 2 = 0.888) and AMP/PM (R 2 = 0.932) and in the overall sample (R 2 = 0.896). No significant correlations were observed between O2 pulse and (a-v)O2diff. It was concluded that in PAthl with different HCs: (1) significant differences, as a consequence of the different HC, exist in the determinants of CO at maximal and submaximal ACE; (2) SV is a significant determinant of VO2peak, suggesting cardiac adaptations possible also in PAthl with SCI; and (3) SV can be predicted from O2 pulse measurements during submaximal exercise in both groups of PAthl.",

        "abstract": "\nThe 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol guideline recommends high-intensity statin (HIS) in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but little is known about the efficacy and safety of HIS in Asian ethnicity. We assessed the effects of HIS in Taiwanese with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).\nConsecutive patients admitted for new AMI between January 2010 and December 2013 without prior statin use were enrolled from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients were grouped based on the intensity of statin they took after discharge. The primary endpoint was the composite outcome of all-cause mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, and stroke. We also compared the incidences of severe hepatitis and myopathy that need admission between HIS and non-HIS groups. We used propensity score analysis to match covariates between groups and Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment to estimate the risks of clinical outcomes.\nAfter 1:4 propensity score match, there were 4402 patients in the HIS group and 17,608 patients in the non-HIS group. After follow-up for 3 years, 668 patients (15.2%) in the HIS group and 2749 (15.6%) in the non-HIS group had the primary composite endpoint. Cox proportional-hazards analyses showed that HIS did not further reduce composite endpoint (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.975; 95% confidence interval, 0.896-1.062); however, HIS patients had a lower risk of ischemic stroke at 3-year follow-up. Regarding safety, HIS did not increase hospitalization rates for severe hepatitis and myopathy.\nPatients with AMI in Taiwan with HIS had similar clinical outcomes to those with non-HIS. Using HIS for the effective reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is safe in Taiwan.",

        "abstract": "\nThere is considerable interest in triaging victims of large vessel occlusion (LVO) strokes to comprehensive stroke centers. Timely access to interventional therapy has been linked to improved stroke outcomes. Accurate triage depends upon the use of a validated screening tool in addition to several emergency medical system (EMS)-specific factors. This study examines the integration of a modified Rapid Arterial oCcclusion Evaluation (mRACE) score into an existing stroke treatment protocol.\nWe performed a retrospective review of EMS and hospital charts of patients transported to a single comprehensive stroke center. Adult patients with an EMS provider impression of \"stroke/TIA,\" \"CVA,\" or \"neurological problem\" were included for analysis. EMS protocols mandated the use of the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Score (CPSS). The novel protocol authorized the use of the mRACE score to identify candidates for triage directly to the comprehensive stroke center. We calculated specificity and sensitivity for various stroke screens (CPSS and a mRACE exam) for the detection of LVO stroke. The score's metrics were evaluated as a surrogate marker for a successful EMS triage protocol.\nWe included 312 prehospital charts in the final analysis. The CPSS score exhibited reliable sensitivity at 85%. Specificity of CPSS for an LVO was calculated at 73%. For an mRACE score of five or greater, the sensitivity was 25%. Specificity for mRACE was calculated at 75%. The positive predictive value of the mRACE score for an LVO was estimated at 12.50%.\nIn this retrospective study of patients triaged to a single comprehensive stroke center, the addition of an LVO-specific screening tool failed to improve accuracy. Reliable triage of LVO strokes in the prehospital setting is a challenging task. In addition to statistical performance of a particular stroke score, a successful EMS protocol should consider system-based factors such as provider education and training. Study limitations can inform future iterations of LVO triage protocols.",

We aimed to investigate the factor structure of the Everyday Memory Questionnaire-Revised (EMQ-R) in stroke survivors with memory complaints, and identify the most commonly endorsed items.Method: A total of 91 stroke survivors completed the EMQ-R prior to participation in a memory rehabilitation trial. A principal components analysis was carried out on the EMQ-R data and reliability analyses were conducted on the resulting subscales. We described the average frequency of occurrence of specific memory complaints in one month, as reported by stroke survivors.Results: The factor analysis yielded a two-component solution which accounted for 60.12% of the variance, suggesting that two subscales termed Forgetting and Attention would be most appropriate for clinical use with stroke survivors. These subscales demonstrated strong internal reliability. A total of 87.9% of the participants reported having word-finding difficulties more than once monthly. Of all EMQ-R items, participants rated word-finding problems as occurring at the highest frequency (once or more daily).Conclusions: Stroke survivors' everyday memory complaints fall into two distinct categories relating to memory and attentional processes. Calculating scores on the two EMQ-R subscales separately may assist clinicians to understand the nature of memory complaints reported by stroke survivors who participate in memory rehabilitation programs, and may enable more targeted outcome measurement in research trials.",

Studies that described the development or design of a model of stroke progression intended for use in economic evaluation were included.

Models that included CI were retained for data extraction, and among the remainder, models that included both stroke recurrence and disability were also retained. Relevance and potential for adaptation for modeling CI were assessed using a standard questionnaire.\nForty modeling studies were identified and categorized into 4 groups: Markov disability/recurrence (k = 29); CI (k = 2); discrete event simulation (k = 4), and other (k = 5). Only 2 modeling studies included CI as an outcome, and both focused on narrow populations at risk of intracranial aneurysm. None of the models allowed for disease progression in the absence of a stroke recurrence. None of the included studies carried out any sensitivity analysis in relation to model design or structure.\nCurrent stroke models used in economic evaluation are not adequate to model poststroke CI or dementia, and will require adaptation to be used for this purpose.",

We report two cases of native valve Bartonella-associated IE events, both affecting adult male patients with a history of alcohol abuse and a low socioeconomic status. Admissions were due to pancytopenia and bleeding in one case and embolic stroke in the other. Blood cultures were negative and IgG indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) were positive for B. henselae/B. quintana in high titers (1/16,384-1/16,384, and 1/32,768 -1/16,384, respectively). Cases were classified as definitive IE events according to modified Duke criteria due to the presence of valve vegetations with at least three minor criteria. One patient required aortic mechanical valve replacement and survived, and the other died after a massive hemorrhagic transformation of his stroke. PCR amplification and sequencing of the 16S ribosomal bacterial DNA from a valve tissue sample obtained at surgery in the patient who survived, confirmed B. quintana as the etiological agent. Bartonella-associated IE is an emerging problem in Chile, present in disadvantaged populations. It should be suspected in patients with culture-negative IE. IFA does not discriminate between B. henselae and B. quintana infection, but high titers suggest IE. Complementary PCR techniques may help to elucidate the final causative agent.",

Patients with SLE have a two-fold increase in the risk of stroke with younger patients (ie, less than 50 years of age) having an ever-higher risk (up to 10-fold). Although the prognosis of SLE has improved, mortality due to cerebrovascular events (CVE) remains unchanged. Cerebrovascular disease may be directly attributed to the disease per se, as a manifestation of neuropsychiatric SLE, or be the result of traditional cardiovascular risk factors accompanying the disease. Elucidation of the underlying mechanism(s) of CVE is essential as it may guide the type of therapy (ie, antithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy versus immunosuppressive). Strokes attributed to lupus usually occur early in the course of the disease and are often accompanied by evidence of activity in other organs; those related to antiphospholipid antibodies can occur at any time, in patients with either active or inactive SLE. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology, work-up, management and primary prevention of CVE in patients with lupus. In view of the effectiveness of thrombolysis, physicians need to educate lupus patients and their families for the early recognition of the signs of stroke and the need to seek prompt attention.

        "title": "Differential Reorganization of SMA Subregions After Stroke: A Subregional Level Resting-State Functional Connectivity Study.",
        "abstract": "\nBackground and Purpose: The human supplementary motor area (SMA) contains two functional subregions of the SMA proper and preSMA; however, the reorganization patterns of the two SMA subregions after stroke remain uncertain. Meanwhile, a focal subcortical lesion may affect the overall functional reorganization of brain networks. We sought to identify the differential reorganization of the SMA subregions after subcortical stroke using the resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis. Methods: Resting-state functional MRI was conducted in 25 patients with chronic capsular stroke exhibiting well-recovered global motor function (Fugl-Meyer score >90). The SMA proper and preSMA were identified by the rsFC-based parcellation, and the rsFCs of each SMA subregion were compared between stroke patients and healthy controls. Results: Despite common rsFC with the fronto-insular cortex (FIC), the SMA proper and preSMA were mainly correlated with the sensorimotor areas and cognitive-related regions, respectively. In stroke patients, the SMA proper and preSMA exhibited completely different functional reorganization patterns: the former showed increased rsFCs with the primary sensorimotor area and caudal cingulate motor area (CMA) of the motor execution network, whereas the latter showed increased rsFC with the rostral CMA of the motor control network. Both of the two SMA subregions showed decreased rsFC with the FIC in stroke patients; the preSMA additionally showed decreased rsFC with the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Conclusion: Although both SMA subregions exhibit functional disconnection with the cognitive-related areas, the SMA proper is implicated in the functional reorganization within the motor execution network, whereas the preSMA is involved in the functional reorganization within the motor control network in stroke patients.",

Heart failure-related mortality and hospital readmissions are high. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical features of patients with HF hospitalized in the Department of Internal Medicine as well as factors associated with readmission and intra-hospital mortality.\nWe conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive, and retrospective study based on the review of the clinical records of patients with primary diagnosis of HF in the Basic Minimum Set of Data (BMSD, Conjunto M&#237;nimo B&#225;sico de Datos),who were discharged from the Department of Internal Medicine of the San Carlos Clinical Hospital (HCSC) in 2014.\nThe study involved 199 patients, with an average age of 82.7 years (61.8% were females); 85% of them had left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 40%, with an average pro-BNP of 9.101,3 pg/ml and 64.3% had ongoing atrial fibrillation. Thirty point two percent of patients were readmitted within 30 days, with an average rate of readmission/year of 1.45 (&#177;0.86). Twenty five percent of patients died during the follow-up period in hospital. Among factors associated with intra-hospital mortality, older age was an associated variable (OR 1,050)(1,002-1,101) (p = 0.04). The most important factors associated with early readmission were polypharmacy (p = 0.024) as well as pluripathology based on Ollero criteria 4,974 (1,396-17,730) (p = 0.024). Patients hospitalized for HF in our Department are elderly patients treated with polymedication.\nPatients hospitalized for cardiac insufficiency are older and are characterized by pluripathology and polypharmacy. Short-term prognosis is associated with high rates of readmission and mortality in hospitalmainly for patients suffering from kidney disease and/or neurological disorders.",

These investments have contributed to substantial advancements in the control and sensory perception of prosthetic devices over the past decade. While control of motorized prosthetic devices through the use of electromyography has been widely available since the 1980s, this technology is not intuitive. Additionally, these systems do not provide stimulation for sensory perception. Recent research has made significant advancement not only in the intuitive use of electromyography for control but also in the ability to provide relevant meaningful perceptions through various stimulation approaches. While much of this previous work has traditionally focused on those with upper extremity amputation, new developments include advanced bidirectional neuroprostheses that are applicable to both the upper and lower limb amputation. The goal of this review is to examine the state-of-the-science in the areas of intuitive control and sensation of prosthetic devices and to discuss areas of exploration for the future.

We designed a multivariable logistic regression model as a function of baseline severity of illness and laboratory tests, developed a nomogram, and applied it to patients from 2010 to 2012. Due to updated guidelines in 2013, we revalidated our model (2016-2017). The final model included stroke type (intracerebral hemorrhage vs ischemic stroke: odds ratio [95% CI] of 0.92 [0.50-1.68] and subarachnoid hemorrhage vs ischemic stroke: 1.0 [0.40-2.49]), year (1.01 [0.66-1.53]), age (1.78 [1.20-2.65] per 10 yr), smoking (8.0 [2.4-26.7]), mean arterial pressure less than 60&#8201;mm Hg (3.08 [1.67-5.67]), Glasgow Coma Scale (0.73 [0.66-0.80] per 1 point increment), WBC less than 11&#8201;K (0.31 [0.16-0.60]), creatinine (1.76 [1.17-2.64] for 2 vs 1), congestive heart failure (2.49 [1.06-5.82]), and warfarin (2.29 [1.17-4.47]). In summary, age, smoking, congestive heart failure, warfarin use, Glasgow Coma Scale, mean arterial pressure less than 60&#8201;mm Hg, admission WBC, and creatinine levels were independently associated with mortality in our training cohort. The model had internal area under the curve of 0.83 (0.79-0.89) after adjustment for over-fitting, indicating excellent discrimination. When applied to the test data from 2010 to 2012, the nomogram accurately predicted mortality with area under the curve of 0.79 (0.71-0.87) and scaled Brier's score of 0.17. Revalidation of the same model in the recent dataset from 2016 to 2017 confirmed accurate prediction with area under the curve of 0.83 (0.75-0.91) and scaled Brier's score of 0.27.\nBaseline medical problems, clinical severity, and basic laboratory tests available within the first 12 hours of admission provided strong independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in elderly acute stroke patients.

The device engages subjects to perform tasks that imitate activities of daily living, e.g. drinking from a cup and moving other complex objects. Sitting at a magnetic table subjects hold a 3D printed cup with an adjustable magnet and move this cup on the table to targets that can be drawn on the table surface. A ball rolling inside the cup can enhance the task challenge by introducing additional dynamics. A single video camera with a portable computer tracks real-time kinematics of the cup and the rolling ball using a custom-developed, color-based computer-vision algorithm. Preliminary verification with marker-based 3D-motion capture demonstrated that the device produces accurate kinematic measurements. Based on the real-time 2D cup coordinates, audio-visual feedback about performance can be delivered to increase motivation. The feasibility of using this device in clinical diagnostics is demonstrated on 2 neurotypical children and also 3 children with upper-extremity impairments in the hospital, where conventional motion-analysis systems are difficult to use. The device meets key needs for clinical practice: 1) a portable solution for quantitative motor assessment for upper-limb movement disorders at non-laboratory clinical settings, 2) a low-cost rehabilitation device that can increase the volume of in-home physical therapy, and 3) the device affords testing and training a variety of motor tasks inspired by daily challenges to enhance self-confidence to participate in day-to-day activities.",

        "abstract": "\nIn the last few decades, types of diseases affecting people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) have shifted as the population ages, with cardiovascular disease becoming a leading cause of death in this population. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasingly common arrhythmia both in the general population and in PLHIV, with an estimated prevalence of 2% to 3% among PLHIV. Prevention of stroke and systemic thromboembolism (SSE) with antithrombotic therapy is a cornerstone of AF treatment and substantially decreases AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although updated guidelines extensively discuss this issue, they do not address the peculiarities of PLHIV. The role of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection as an independent factor for SSE in individuals with AF and whether the presence of HIV should alter the threshold for SSE thromboprophylaxis are unknown. Nevertheless, a growing body of evidence describes the increasing burden of comorbidities such as hypertension and stroke in PLHIV, which predispose them to AF and SSE. In the absence of HIV-specific AF guidelines, PLHIV with AF should be comprehensively assessed for their risk of SSE and bleeding using commonly available scores despite them having been primarily validated in the non-HIV population. Both vitamin K antagonists and direct oral anticoagulants can be used in PLHIV. Addressing HIV-related comorbidities and potential drug-drug interactions with antiretrovirals is crucial to prevent SSE and reduce adverse reactions of oral anticoagulants. This review summarizes the current guidelines for SSE prevention in patients with AF and describes key considerations for their implementation among PLHIV receiving antiretroviral therapy.",

An environmental scan was undertaken to determine the potential of existing databases to provide national and provincial estimates. On the basis of validated administrative codes, the Canadian Institute for Health Information discharge abstract database can be used for inpatients.

We studied the effects of changing loading conditions with the administration of phenylephrine (&#916;    P &#175;  Ao    &#8805;&#160;+25 mm Hg), isoproterenol (&#916;HR &#8764;+25%), sodium nitroprusside (&#916;    P &#175;  Ao    &#8805;&#160;-25 mm Hg), and proximal aortic constriction (to maximize developed P LV and minimize Q Ao ).\nSodium nitroprusside and isoproterenol increased G SV compared with phenylephrine and constriction. A maximum head-capacity curve was derived from pooled data using nonlinear regression on the maximum    P &#175;  LV    values in Q Ao bins 12.5 mL/min/kg wide. The head-capacity relation and the plots of conductance were combined using CI as a common axis, which illustrated that CI is the output of the heart and the input of the circulation.\nThus, at a given CI, G SV determines the driving pressure and, thereby, P Ao . We also demonstrated how decreases in G SV compensate for arterial hypotension by restoring the arteriovenous pressure difference and arterial pressure.",

Here, we report the case of a patient with Trousseau syndrome which developed as a complication during chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer. A 70-year-old woman with multiple lymph node metastases of gastric cancer underwent TS-1 plus CDDP chemotherapy before surgery. She had symptoms of left hemiparesis during the first course of chemotherapy. She was diagnosed with acute cerebralinfarction using brain MRI, and blood tests indicated hypercoagulability. Therefore, it was strongly suspected that she had Trousseau syndrome. A total of 2 courses of chemotherapy were administered, along with anticoagulation therapy with edoxaban. She exhibited improved paralysis and received a totalgastrectomy after chemotherapy. According to recent reports, more than 90% of patients with malignant tumors have hypercoagulability, and more than 50% of them have thromboembolisms. It is therefore essential to obtain early diagnosis and provide anticoagulation therapy for cerebral infarction, and to provide treatment against malignant diseases in patients with Trousseau syndrome.",

Multifocal thrombosis was probably due to the initial congenital deficiency of anticoagulants, accompanied by a decrease in antithrombin III and protein C, against the background of their critical consumption in cascade thrombosis, in combination with the carrier of polymorphisms of moderate and low thrombogenic risk. This case is unique in that there is usually a tendency toward clinical thrombosis when the level of antithrombin III is less than 70%. Such patients develop thrombosis at a younger age, and by the age of 35-40 years usually have a verified diagnosis of extremely high-risk hereditary thrombophilia. In this case, multifocal thrombosis was accompanied by critically low values of anticoagulants: antithrombin III - 3.4%, and protein C - 36.8%. The patient had suffered from epilepsy since childhood and took anticonvulsant drugs that increase the deficit of active folic acid and can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia, which in this case, against the background of an innate decrease in the activity of methyltetrahydrofolate reductase, could have aggravated the situation. <Learning objective: To focus on the possibility of the manifestation of multifocal thrombosis in congenital thrombophilia in adulthood against the background of critically low values of anticoagulants - antithrombin III and protein C.>.",

The advent of hs-cTn testing, as opposed to conventional troponin testing, led to additional difficulties in result interpretation. Most frequently, though not exclusively, increased cTn levels in acute or chronic failure is correlated, with myocardial necrosis (AMI); the diagnosis of AMI is confirmed if other criteria are fulfilled, as described in the fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. Increased cTn levels below the cut-off for AMI suggest acute or chronic injury, depending on the ascending and/or descending trend curve or stable levels of cTn on serial testing. In acute or chronic HF with reduced or preserved EF, increased cTn levels carry prognostic value for adverse outcomes. Acute and chronic HF, as well as other ischemic or non-ischemic conditions, may lead to a transient increase in cTn levels: hypertensive crises, tachyarrhythmias, valvular regurgitation, myocarditis, stroke, mandating differential diagnosis with ACS. There are multiple mechanisms that explain increased levels of cTn: myocardial necrosis or coronary thrombosis (type I MI), supply-demand mismatch with subendocardial ischemia/injury, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, inflammatory cytokines, neurohomonal changes. Screening for cTn levels in the population at high cardiovascular risk yields prognostic information on development of de novo HF or other cardiovascular adverse events.",

Here we demonstrated that post-ischemic treatment with ciclopirox olamine (CPX), a potent antifungal clinical drug, alleviated brain infarction, neurological deficits and brain edema in a classic rat model of ischemic stroke. Single dose post-ischemic administration of CPX provided a long-lasting neuroprotective effect, which can be further enhanced by multiple doses administration of CPX. CPX also effectively reversed ischemia-induced neuronal loss, glial activation as well as blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage. Employing quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis, 130 phosphosites in 122 proteins were identified to be significantly regulated by CPX treatment in oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD)-exposed SH-SY5Y cells, which revealed that phosphokinases and cell cycle-related phosphoproteins were largely influenced. Subsequently, we demonstrated that CPX markedly enhanced the AKT (protein kinase B, PKB/AKT) and GSK3&#946; (glycogen synthase kinase 3&#946;) phosphorylation in OGD-exposed SH-SY5Y cells, and regulated the cell cycle progression and nitric oxide (NO) release in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced BV-2&#160;cells, which may contribute to its ameliorative effects against ischemia-associated neuronal death and microglial inflammation.

However, recent studies indicate that stroke is among the most common dangerous missed diagnoses. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), which was first introduced in the early 1990s among clinical concerns, has become an invaluable tool in the evaluation processes of patients with suspected ischemic stroke. Objective Herein, it is aimed to investigate the reliability of the interpretation of DWI in the diagnosis of stroke by emergency physicians. Methods DWIs of the patients, evaluated in the Emergency Service of Yozgat City Hospital from April 1, 2017 to September 1, 2017, were retrospectively evaluated by four emergency physicians (specialists) separately in a blind and random fashion. The reliability of the evaluations was calculated using Kappa analyses on SPSS Statistics 20. Results DWI of 154 patients was enrolled in this study. Kappa values were determined to be as 0.911 (almost perfect), 0.909 (almost perfect), 0.897 (almost perfect), 0.779 (substantial), respectively. Discussion The results of this study may suggest that the reliability of DWI interpretation by emergency physicians was pretty high, even it can still be improved. Combining the literature data remarking a substantial number of misdiagnosed stroke patients in the emergency department (ED) and study results, it can be hypothesized that the major problem may be related with rather clinical evaluation processes as well as insufficient neurology consultation. Future reports are warranted to understand the basic problems of stroke evaluation processes in the ED.

For example, V1a receptor activation triggers vasoconstriction, V1b receptor is responsible for modulation of mood and behavior, and V2 receptor induces water reabsorption in the kidney. Vasopressin is known to regulate blood pressure, blood osmolality, and blood volume. The effects of V1a and V2 receptors can be amplified when vasopressin is secreted in excessive amounts, and this condition may be experienced by patients undergoing a disease or stress.

        "title": "The significant gap between international standards and stroke management practices at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (Malawi): An audit report.",
        "abstract": "\nThe Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital (QECH) is preparing to set up the first stroke unit in Blantyre, Malawi. We conducted this audit to assess current stroke management practices and outcomes at QECH and identify priority areas for intervention.\nFrom April to June 2018, we prospectively enrolled patients with acute stroke and collected data on clinical presentation, cardiovascular risk factors, investigations and interventions, in-hospital outcomes, and follow-up plans after discharge. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guidelines were used as the standard of care for comparison.\nFifty patients with acute stroke were enrolled (46% women, 54% men). The mean age was 63.1 years (95% CI: 59.7-66.6). The diagnosis of stroke was based on the World Health Organization criteria. The diagnosis was made within 24 hours of admission in 19 patients (38%). Acute revascularisation therapy was not available. Forty-eight patients (96%) had their vital signs checked at baseline and <10% had their vital signs checked more than three times within the first 24 hours. Essential blood tests including random blood sugar (RBS), full blood count (FBC), urea/creatinine, and lipid profiles were performed in 72%, 68%, 48%, and 4%, respectively. An electrocardiogram was performed on 34 patients (68%). Blood pressure on admission was >140/90 mmHg in 34 patients (68%), including 4 with values >220/120 mmHg. Nine patients had an RBS >10 mmol/L and four received insulin. Prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis was offered to 12 patients (24%). Aspiration pneumonia was reported in 16 patients (32%) and was the most common hospital complication. The mean duration of hospitalisation was 10.4 days (95% CI: 5.6-15.2), and case fatality was 18%. The modified Rankin scale at discharge was &#8804;2 in 32% of patients. Only four patients (8%) were transferred to a rehabilitation centre. At the time of discharge, only 32% of patients received education on stroke.\nAcute stroke care is less than optimal in this setting. Simple interventions such as reducing the delay in making a stroke diagnosis, early swallow assessments, and closer monitoring of vital signs could make a significant difference in stroke outcome. Furthermore, treating cardiovascular risk factors and setting up health education programmes to improve secondary prevention represent key priorities.",

        "abstract": "\nNon-communicable diseases (NCD) are of international public health concern. Of more concern are people living with HIV (PLHIV), who have the increased risk of developing NCDs, such as hypertension, stroke and diabetes. Research has revealed that there is a relationship between knowledge of NCD risk factors and risk perceptions in the general population. Therefore, an assessment of PLHIV's NCD risk factors knowledge is quite critical, to design effective NCD prevention programmes.\nTo assess the level of knowledge of modifiable risk factors for NCDs and its associated factors among adults living with HIV in Rwanda.\nA cross-sectional quantitative design was used to collect the data. The study targeted PLHIV who visited the out-patients' public health centres in three purposively selected provinces of Rwanda. The knowledge assessment questionnaire relating to risk factors for chronic diseases of lifestyle was used to collect the data. Data were analysed using SPSS version 23.\nOf the 794 respondents, 64.6% were women, and the mean age was 37.9 (&#177;10.8) years. The results revealed that the majority of the respondents (65.0%) had low levels of knowledge about NCD risk factors, while some (35.6%) were of the opinion that they had a low risk of contracting NCDs. Good knowledge was significantly associated with high educational status, a low CD4+ cell count (< 350 cells/mm3) and normotension.\nThe current study findings highlight the need for comprehensive health education, to raise awareness of non-communicable diseases' risk factors for adults living with HIV in Rwanda.",

The present study aims to further investigate the p122RhoGAP/DLC-1 protein. We examined molecules assisting this protein and identified a scaffold protein-IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1). IQGAP1-C binds to the steroidogenic acute regulatory-related lipid transfer (START) domain of p122RhoGAP/DLC-1, and PLC-&#948;1 binds to IQGAP1-N, forming a complex. In fluorescence microscopy, small dots of PLC-&#948;1 created fine linear arrays like microtubules, and IQGAP1 and p122RhoGAP/DLC-1 were colocated in the cytoplasm with PLC-&#948;1. Ionomycin induced the raft recruitment of the PLC-&#948;1, IQGAP1, and p122RhoGAP/DLC-1 complex by translocation to the plasma membrane (PM), indicating the movement of this complex is along microtubules with the motor protein kinesin. Moreover, the IQGAP1 protein was elevated in skin fibroblasts obtained from patients with CSA, and it enhanced the PLC activity and peak intracellular calcium concentration in response to acetylcholine. IQGAP1, a novel stimulating protein, forms a complex with p122RhoGAP/DLC-1 and PLC-&#948;1 that moves along microtubules and enhances the PLC activity.",

An acute event causing a change in the pressure relationships inside the cardiac chambers can lead to the diagnosis of a previously undiagnosed cardiac anomaly, as the following case illustrates.\nA previously asymptomatic 80-year-old female patient was admitted in our hospital with a sudden onset ischaemic stroke. Initial evaluation, including 12-lead electrocardiogram and transthoracic echocardiogram, was unremarkable. During hospital stay, she develops pulmonary embolism, after which she complains of positional dyspnoea that develops upon sitting up, accompanied with refractory hypoxaemia that reverts on recumbent position. Transoesophageal echocardiogram revealed an interatrial septum with an exuberant hyperdynamic movement, and an abundant passage of contrast from the right atrium to the left, even without performing the Valsalva manoeuvre, compatible with an important patent foramen ovale. A percutaneous closure was performed, and patient has been symptom-free since then.\nThis is a case illustrates how an anomaly that has been present for 80&#8201;years can suddenly manifest itself with an array of different symptoms that can make the diagnosis challenging.

The prevalence of SM can be as high as 31% in some reports, and these patients are potentially at the risk of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) therapy and its complications. This study was designed to determine the prevalence of our center's SM (Firoozgar Hospital) among patients who received IVT, their baseline characteristics, final diagnoses, and outcomes. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of all patients who received IVT between June 2015 and May 2018. The following variables were collected: demographic characteristics, past medical history, onset-to-needle (OTN) time, door-to-needle (DTN) time, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at admission, brain imaging, and all paraclinic findings. Functional outcome at discharge based on modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was also assessed. Results: 10 out of 165 (6.0%) patients including 8 men and 4 women were finally diagnosed with SM. The median age and NIHSS score at presentation were 60 years and 7, respectively. Final diagnoses were seizure (n = 6), hemiplegic migraine (n = 2), conversion (n = 1), and alcohol intoxication (n = 1). All patients were discharged with a mRS score of 0 and 1 without experiencing any thrombolytic adverse effects. Conclusion: None of the patients with SM experienced any adverse effect of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) including hemorrhage and all of them reached good mRS score. This shows that tPA is generally safe and the risk of treating patients with SM is very low and making a vital treatment decision may outweigh the risk of neglected cases in a time-sensitive setting.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground: Mobile stroke units (MSUs) are the latest approach to improving time-sensitive stroke care delivery. Currently, there are no published studies looking at the expanded value of the MSU to diagnose and transport patients to the closest most appropriate facility. The purpose of this paper is to perform a cost consequence analysis of standard transport (ST) vs. MSU. Methods and Results: A cost consequence analysis was undertaken within a decision framework to compare the incremental cost of care for patients with confirmed stroke that were served by the MSU vs. their simulated care had they been served by standard emergency medical services between July 2014 and October 2015. At baseline values, the incremental cost between MSU and ST was $70,613 ($856,482 vs. $785,869) for 355 patient transports. The MSU avoided 76 secondary interhospital transfers and 76 emergency department (ED) encounters. Sensitivity analysis identified six variables that had measurable impact on the model's variability and a threshold value at which MSU becomes the optimal strategy: number of stroke patients (>391), probability of requiring transfer to a comprehensive stroke center (CSC, >0.52), annual cost of MSU operations (<$696,053), cost of air transfer (>$8,841), probability initial receiving hospital is a CSC (<0.32), and probability of ischemic stroke with ST (<0.76). Conclusions: MSUs can avert significant costs in the administration of stroke care once optimal thresholds are achieved. A comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis is required to determine not just the operational value of an MSU but also its clinical value to patients and the society.",

        "abstract": "\nSocial cognition is the innate human ability to interpret the emotional state of others from contextual verbal and non-verbal information, and to self-regulate accordingly. Facial expressions are one of the most relevant sources of non-verbal communication, and their interpretation has been extensively investigated in the literature, using both behavioral and physiological measures, such as those derived from visual activity and visual responses. The decoding of facial expressions of emotion is performed by conscious and unconscious cognitive processes that involve a complex brain network that can be damaged after cerebrovascular accidents. A diminished ability to identify facial expressions of emotion has been reported after stroke, which has traditionally been attributed to impaired emotional processing. While this can be true, an alteration in visual behavior after brain injury could also negatively contribute to this ability. This study investigated the accuracy, distribution of responses, visual behavior, and pupil dilation of individuals with stroke while identifying emotional facial expressions. Our results corroborated impaired performance after stroke and exhibited decreased attention to the eyes, evidenced by a diminished time and number of fixations made in this area in comparison to healthy subjects and comparable pupil dilation. The differences in visual behavior reached statistical significance in some emotions when comparing individuals with stroke with impaired performance with healthy subjects, but not when individuals post-stroke with comparable performance were considered. The performance dependence of visual behavior, although not determinant, might indicate that altered visual behavior could be a negatively contributing factor for emotion recognition from facial expressions.",

We report the analysis of all AIS patients throughout a 6-year experience following the deployment of a quality initiative aiming at improving care, speed and maintaining quality for AIS treatment. Methods: Using a prospectively collected endovascular database at a comprehensive stroke center between 2012 and 2017, workflow/outcomes were recorded. There were no exclusion criteria. During the first year, a quality program employing \"digital-object\" technology, staff education, and workflow improvement was implemented to reduce time-to-treatment. Using electronic recording, workflow times were collected for onset (TO), CT (TCT), door (TD), angiography-suite (TA), groin puncture (TG), DSA (TDSA), and recanalization (TR). Recanalization time (TG-TR) and workflow intervals were compared at Year 1 and 6. Results: Analysis of 382 patients (aged 71.3 &#177; 12.9) undergoing mechanical thrombectomy for AIS (206 male and 176 female) was performed. Recanalization time was significantly reduced from 82 min in 2012 to 34 min by 2017 (IQR 52-117 min and 23-49 min), a 59% reduction (P < 0.001). Further, consistent year-over-year reductions in setup time (TA-TG) (44% improvement) and TCT to TA times were observed. During the same period, clinical outcome significantly improved year-over-year as measured with the modified Rankin Scale 0-2 (33, 37, 38, 41, 53, and 58%). Conclusions: Significant improvements were observed following the deployment of a quality initiative enabling iterative evidence-based process improvements, thereby sustaining significant reductions in time-to-treat and improved clinical outcomes for AIS patients.",

Methods: Twenty-two inpatients and outpatients with stroke-induced impairments were randomly assigned into two groups: an underwater treadmill gait training with water-jet resistance group (n = 11) and an underwater treadmill gait training with ankle weights group (n = 11). Participants received conventional physical therapy for 30 min and underwater treadmill gait training with water-jet resistance or ankle weights for 30 min. Intervention was performed 5 days a week for 4 weeks. The Balance System SD was used to assess static and dynamic balance. The GAITRite system was used to assess gait velocity, cadence, step length, stride length, and swing phase. All measurements were performed at the beginning of the study and 4 weeks after the intervention. Results: The water-jet resistance group and ankle weights group showed significant improvement in static balance (P < 0.00 vs. P = 0.01), dynamic balance (P < 0.00 vs. P = 0.57), gait velocity (P < 0.00 vs. P = 0.037), cadence (P < 0.00 vs. P = 0.001), step length (P < 0.00 vs. P = 0.003), stride length (P < 0.00 vs. P = 0.023), and swing phase (P < 0.00 vs. P < 0.00). However, the static and dynamic balance ability score (P < 0.00), gait velocity (P < 0.00), cadence (P < 0.00), step length (P < 0.00), stride length (P < 0.00), and swing phase (P = 0.023) in the group that received underwater treadmill gait training with water-jet resistance improved more than in the group that received underwater treadmill gait training with ankle weights. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that underwater treadmill gait training with water-jet resistance is effective in improving static and dynamic balance as well as gait abilities in chronic stroke patients. Thus, training using underwater treadmill gait training with water-jet resistance may be useful in facilitating active rehabilitation in chronic stroke patients.",

        "abstract": "\nThe inflammatory response associated with myocardial and brain ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) is a critical determinant of tissue necrosis, functional organ recovery, and long-term clinical outcomes. In the post-ischemic period, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in tissue repair through the clearance of dead cells and cellular debris. Neutrophils play a critical role in redox signaling due to their early recruitment and the large variety of released ROS. Noteworthy, ROS generated during IRI have a relevant role in both myocardial healing and activation of neuroprotective pathways. Anatomical and functional differences contribute to the responses in the myocardial and brain tissue despite a significant gene overlap. The exaggerated activation of this signaling system can result in adverse consequences, such as cell apoptosis and extracellular matrix degradation. In light of that, blocking the ROS cascade might have a therapeutic implication for cardiomyocyte and neuronal loss after acute ischemic events. The translation of these findings from preclinical models to clinical trials has so far failed because of differences between humans and animals, difficulty of agents to penetrate into specific cellular organs, and specifically unravel oxidant and antioxidant pathways. Here, we update knowledge on ROS cascade in IRI, focusing on the role of neutrophils. We discuss evidence of ROS blockade as a therapeutic approach for myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke.",

Our aim was to study how these processes affected hand actions in chronic stroke patients, based on whether they had limb apraxia. Twenty-two left hemisphere, chronic stroke patients were measured on neuropsychological tasks of limb apraxia, which was identified in a subgroup of 10 patients. All patients underwent testing on a separate task of making simple reach and grasp actions to a cup. Their performance was compared to a group of 18 healthy age-matched volunteers. Participants were instructed to grasp the top or bottom of a cup to either lift or turn it over so as to end with a hand position that was either comfortable or uncomfortable. This task tested the influence of the compatibility of hand-cup orientation, as well as goals driven by the end-state comfort of the hand, on action selection for object manipulation. Participants' performance was measured in terms of error rates, and speed of initiation and reaching (movement time) to the object. The patients' performance was significantly delayed, and error rates increased when reaching to grasp a cup under conditions of poor compatibility and end-state comfort. The subgroup of patients with apraxia showed a decreased influence of compatibility of hand interaction with the cup, with increased error rates and delayed response times, compared to patients with no apraxia and healthy volunteers. This is despite the fact they did not display significant deficits on neuropsychological tasks of real object use. The study shows that patients with apraxia have difficulties in selecting elements of object-directed actions, pertaining to both habitual and goal-directed factors.",

The effect on V1a receptors is connected with arterial vasoconstriction, on V2 with antidiuretic action, and on V1b with the secretion of ACTH, insulin, glucagon. Copeptin is found in the circulation in equimolar amounts with AVP. It is a very stable peptide and easy to estimate. Copeptin is a good diagnostic marker in many disorders in which vasopressinergic dysfunction plays a role in pathogenesis such as a polyuria-polydipsia syndrome, neurological disease (ischemic stroke, nontraumatic, intracerebral hemorrhage, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and neurodegenerative disease (multiple sclerosis). Copeptin is a diagnostic and prognostic marker in cardiovascular diseases like heart failure (HF) and acute myocardial infarct (AMI). Copeptin is a sensitive diagnostic marker in the early stage of AMI especially in patients with non-ST segment elevation and post AMI complications. Copeptin is also an important diagnostic and prognostic marker in metabolic diseases (diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance), connected with some neurological and cardiovascular diseases.

Vasculopathy was associated with mean prior values for hemoglobin (odds ratio 0.33, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.69, P&#160;=&#160;0.003; n&#160;=&#160;87), oxygen content (odds ratio 0.43, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.74, P&#160;=&#160;0.003), reticulocytes (odds ratio 1.20, 95% CI 1.01-1.42, P&#160;=&#160;0.041; n&#160;=&#160;77), and indirect bilirubin (odds ratio 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.04, P&#160;=&#160;0.009).\nSCI and vasculopathy on MRA are common in neurologically asymptomatic children with SCA living in Africa, even when TCD is normal. Children with vasculopathy on MRA are at increased risk of SCI. Longitudinal exposure to anemia, hypoxia, and hemolysis appear to be risk factors for vasculopathy.",

        "abstract": "\nInternal jugular vein thrombosis is a rare critical cardiovascular emergency, which has potential catastrophic clinical outcomes by resulting in stroke and pulmonary embolism. Several etiologies have been reported; however, there are limited data on Lemierre's and Trousseau's syndromes, which are both rare conditions with advanced disease progression and poor clinical outcomes. Lemierre's syndrome may present with typical progressively infectious symptoms and signs, including sore throat, neck mass, and fever, whereas Trousseau's syndrome may present with thrombophlebitis and painful edema. Without antibiotic agents controlling the infection, the condition of patients with Lemierre's syndrome may progress to sepsis or septic shock. The infection pattern plays an important role for differential diagnosis. Herein, we describe the case of a 46-year-old woman presenting with atypical symptoms of Trousseau's syndrome mimicking Lemierre's syndrome. Laboratory analysis including protein C, protein S, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibody ruled out hypercoagulopathy and autoimmune vasculitis. Abdominal computed tomography and panendoscopy revealed ulcerative tumor at the antrum. Pathological examination confirmed the presence of signet-ring cell adenocarcinoma. We highlight the clinical features and etiologies of internal jugular vein thrombosis, especially in Lemierre's syndrome and Trousseau's syndrome, to aid physicians in making an early diagnosis and providing timely management.",

        "abstract": "\nThrombus formed in blood vessel is a progressive process, which would lead to life-threatening thrombotic diseases such as ischemic stroke. Unlike other diseases, the recognition of thrombus is usually in the late stage where blood vessels are largely blocked. So acute thrombotic diseases have a narrow therapeutic&#160;window, and remain leading causes of morbidity and mortality, whereas current thrombolysis therapy has limited therapeutic effects and bleeding complications. Thrombolytic agents in unwanted sites would cause hemorrhage due to the activation of plasminogen. Moreover, untargeted thrombolysis therapy require large amounts of thrombolytic agents, which in return would enhance hemorrhage risk. To improve the&#160;efficiency while minimizing the adverse effects of traditional thrombolysis therapy, novel drug delivery systems have been investigated. Various targeting strategies including ultrasound and magnetic field directed targeting, and specific binding, have been designed to deliver thrombolytic drugs to the thrombotic sites. These strategies demonstrate promising results in reducing bleeding risk as well as allowing less dosage of thrombolytic drugs with lowered clot lysis time. In this review, we discuss recent progress on targeted delivery of thrombolytics, and summarize treatment advantages and shortcomings, potentially helping to further promote the development of targeted thrombolysis.",

Studies published between January 2010 and August 2017 meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria were selected; guidelines were also included. Two rounds of screening were applied to select studies of relevance.\nWorldwide data showed approximately 5-8% prevalence of CAD and 10-20% prevalence of PAD, dependent on the study design, average age, gender, and geographical location. Data from the REACH registry indicated that 18-35% of patients with CAD and 46-68% of patients with PAD had disease in one or more vascular beds. Use of medication to control modifiable CV risk factors was variable by country (lower in France than in Canada); statins and aspirin were the most widely used therapies in patients with chronic disease.

Some intermediary mechanisms of fatty liver disease (including its histological component steatosis) include tissue hypoxia, low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress that are key features of COPD. Despite these shared physiological pathways, the effect of COPD on the prevalence of hepatic steatosis, and the association between hepatic steatosis and comorbidities in this population remain unclear. Liver density measured by computed tomography (CT)-scan is a non-invasive surrogate of fat infiltration, with lower liver densities reflecting more fat infiltration and a liver density of 40 Hounsfield Units (HU) corresponding to a severe 30% fat infiltration.\nWe took advantage of the international cohort ECLIPSE in which non-enhanced chest CT-scans were obtained in 1554 patients with COPD and 387 healthy controls to analyse the liver density at T12-L1.\nThe distribution of liver density was similar and the prevalence of severe steatosis (density<40 HU) was not different (4.7% vs 5.2%, p=0.7) between COPD and controls. In patients with COPD, the lowest liver density quartile was associated, after age and sex adjustment, with coronary artery disease (ORa=1.59, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.24) and stroke (ORa=2.20, 95% CI 1.07 to 4.50), in comparison with the highest liver density quartile.\nThe present data indicate that a low liver density emerged as a predictor of cardiovascular comorbidities in the COPD population. However, the distribution of liver density and the prevalence of severe steatosis were similar in patients with COPD and control subjects.",

Thus, nanodiamond could provide a drug delivery system to shuttle several drugs through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which represents a real challenge for the effective delivery of several drugs into the brain. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that cannot pass through BBB and may elicit neuroprotective effects to reverse calcium-induced excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction that underlie several neurologic disorders including Alzheimer's disease and stroke.\nThe study aimed to investigate the loading of amlodipine on nanodiamond particles.\nNanodiamond particles were oxidized in a strong oxidizing acidic mixture of sulfuric and nitric acids. Adsorption of amlodipine on nanodiamond particles was achieved in alkaline pH using various concentrations of sodium hydroxide. The loaded amlodipine was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography and confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy.\nThe highest percentage (41%) of loaded amlodipine onto nanodiamond particles was achieved in alkaline medium using 2 mM NaOH at a corresponding pH of 8.5. Also, characteristic FTIR bands of amlodipine and nanodiamond were shown obviously in the nanodiamond-amlodipine conjugates. Moreover, the successful loading of amlodipine on diamond nanoparticles was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy.\nThe present study demonstrates the successful loading of amlodipine onto nanodiamond particles. These findings offer a potential for applying diamond nanoparticles as a drug delivery system to shuttle amlodipine into the brain and open the door to deliver other similar drugs into the brain.",

We evaluated the ability of the device to objectively measure gait and time in bed and to generate novel visualizations of home activity. We captured 353 days of monitoring. Mean gait speed (0.39-0.78 m/s), time in bed per day (4.4-12.1 h), and number (1.4-5.9) and duration (15.0-49.8 min) of nightly awakenings varied substantially across and within individuals. Derived gait speed correlated well with the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale total (r = -0.88, p = 0.009) and motor sub-score (r = -0.95, p = 0.001). Six of the seven participants agreed that their activity was typical and indicated a willingness to continue monitoring.

        "abstract": "\nStroke is a major cause of death worldwide. The rupture of atherosclerotic carotid plaques is the leading single cause of stroke. Currently there is no accepted clinical measure to quantitatively assess the risk of carotid plaque rupture. Structural analyses of vulnerable plaques, using finite element (FE) analysis, have retrospectively found that regions of high stress tend to be the site of plaque rupture. The current study proposes a new clinical measure, based on plaque geometry, to assess the risk of carotid plaque rupture. This measure, named the weighted curvature difference, is based on the curvature of both the lumen and intima-media boundary, and the local plaque thickness. A series of idealized and realistic, 2-D and 3-D geometries are used to systematically assess this novel geometrical metric. The areas predicted to be at high risk of rupture using this geometrical metric are compared with areas of high stress, obtained from both isotropic and anisotropic material models. These results are also compared with areas in diseased carotid arteries that are predicted to have high damage accumulation in collagen fibres using a continuum damage model. Results show the new geometrical metric consistently predicts the locations of high stress in all of the vessel geometries examined. The drawbacks of using lumen curvature only as a risk measure are highlighted; particularly in the case of outward remodelled vessels. Weighted curvature difference shows great potential to be used as a metric to efficiently distinguish the rupture prone areas in a diseased vessels in a way that is independent of material properties.",

Despite more than 30 years of research, the acute treatment of stroke-like episodes remains controversial. Methods: We used the modified Delphi process to harness the clinical expertise of a group of mitochondrial disease specialists from five European countries to produce consensus guidance for the acute management of stroke-like episodes and commonly associated complications. Results: Consensus on a new definition of mitochondrial stroke-like episodes was achieved and enabled the group to develop diagnostic criteria based on clinical features, neuroimaging and/or electroencephalogram findings. Guidelines for the management of strokelike episodes were agreed with aggressive seizure management strongly recommended at the outset of stroke-like episodes. Conclusions: Our consensus statement defines stroke-like episodes in terms of an epileptic encephalopathy and we have used this to revise both diagnostic criteria and guidelines for management. A prospective, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial is required for evaluating the efficacy of any compound on modifying the trajectory of stroke-like episodes.",

Her medical history included cerebral infarction, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Magnetic resonance imaging performed in the emergency room revealed cerebral infarction of the left temporal lobe. After hospitalization in the neurosurgery department, we performed further clinical investigations to diagnose the type of stroke. There was no significant stenosis with plaque of the carotid and cerebral arteries, and there were no sources of cardiac embolism or an episode of atrial arrhythmia. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) showed PFO with separation and the Eustachian valve. In addition, spontaneous bidirectional shunt flow through the PFO was detected by TEE with the patient at rest. Ultrasonography of the leg vein revealed a thrombus in the deep vein. Therefore, she was diagnosed as having paradoxical embolism of stroke-related PFO and prescribed a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC). This very rare case in which stroke-related PFO was diagnosed in a nonagenarian patient demonstrates that PFO is the cause of paradoxical embolism of stroke regardless of age.",

Finally, all new MCVEs were risk factors for subsequent acute kidney injury (AKI) {HF: hazard ratio [HR] 8.99 [95% confidence interval (CI) 7.06-11.4]; AF: HR 5.42 (3.91-7.52); ACS: HR 8.82 (6.24-12.5); all P&#8201;<&#8201;0.0001} and ESRD [HF: HR 5.52 (95% CI 4.01-7.60), P&#8201;<&#8201;0.0001; AF: HR 3.48 (2.30-5.21), P&#8201;<&#8201;0.0001; ACS: HR 2.31 (1.43-3.73), P&#8201;=&#8201;0.0006]. The AF- and HF-associated risks of ESRD were significant after adjustments on all renal risks of ESRD (gender, blood pressure, eGFR, albuminuria, renin-angiotensin blockers, retinopathy and AKI), but the association was less strong for ACS. Importantly, no association was noted between other major events such as stroke or infections and the risk of ESRD.\nPast and new cardiovascular events (more HF and AF than ACS) have a strong, independent impact on the development of ESRD above and beyond established risk factors in diabetes.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground: The Movement Disorder Society's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDSUPDRS), Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Autonomic (SCOPA-AUT), Mayo Sleep Questionnaire, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) are validated instruments for assessing signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Objective: We sought to determine whether responses on the MDS-UPDRS correlate with responses to other scales used in patients with PD. Design: Study subjects were enrolled in the Arizona Study of Aging and Neurodegenerative Disorders (AZSAND). Participants were selected if they had completed all scales within a one-month window. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated. Results: A total of 96 eligible subjects were identified. High correlation (r-values) was found between the SCOPA-AUT and MDS-UPDRS excessive saliva (0.73; p<0.001), constipation (0.62; p<0.001), and swallowing (0.59; p<0.001) questions. The r-values for the NPI-Q and MDS-UPDRS depression and anxiety questions were 0.53 (p<0.001), and 0.67 (p<0.001). Conclusion: MDS-UPDRS correlates well with some but not all questions from the SCOPA-AUT and NPI-Q. This work emphasizes the importance of employing multiple methods for assessing nonmotor symptoms in patients with PD.",

Demographic characteristics of the patients, comorbidities, medical, and surgical histories, operative and laboratory results, electrocardiographic findings, postoperative intensive care unit and ward outcomes, and cardiac follow-up data were recorded. Atrial fibrillation-related medication use, stroke, or other thromboembolic events, and electrocardiographic reports in patients who underwent cryoablation were reviewed at three and 12 months after the operation.\nA total of 76 robotic-assisted concomitant procedures were performed during mitral valve repair (n=11) or replacement (n=23) in 34 patients. These procedures were cryoablation (n=29), tricuspid valve repair (n=6), tricuspid valve replacement (n=2), left atrial appendage ligation (n=32), atrial septal defect and patent foramen ovale closure (n=5), and left atrial thrombectomy (n=2). The mean preoperative EuroSCORE values were 5.1&#177;2.5. The mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp was 156&#177;69.4 min and 101&#177;42 min, respectively. Normal sinus rhythm was restored in 85% of the patients (24/28) after cryoablation and two patients (5.8%) had permanent pacemaker within a year during follow-up. There was one (2.9%) mortality in the early postoperative period due to hemorrhage related to the posterior left ventricular wall rupture. No blood product was used in 82.4% of the patients. One patient had a transient cerebral event and symptoms regressed completely within two months.\nTechnological improvements and growing experience can decrease the suspects related to prolonged operational duration during robotic-assisted cardiac surgery. Concomitant procedures in addition to mitral valve operations can be performed with low complication rates in centers with experience of robotic surgery.",

Stroke and mortality rates in the early postoperative period (within the first 30 days), postoperative blood pressure alterations at six and 24 hours, non-neurological outcomes, and baseline demographic characteristics were analyzed and compared between the groups.\nBoth groups showed similar results in terms of the demographic characteristics. There was no statistically significant difference in the postoperative blood pressure alterations at six (p=0.917) and 24 hours (p=0.6), stroke rate (7.6% vs. 3.1%, p=0.282), mortality rate (3.8% vs. 2.1%, p=0.519), non-neurological complications (15.3% vs. 11.4%, p=0.736), and length of hospital stay (p>0.05) between the groups. The patients with contralateral severe internal carotid artery stenosis were younger (p=0.005).\nThe present study shows that the presence of a contralateral severe internal carotid artery stenosis does not increase the risk of postoperative stroke and mortality rates and blood pressure alterations.

In this study, we conducted a targeted metabolomic study to examine the association between serum levels of amino acids and functional recovery after stroke. Three hundred and fifty-one patients with stroke admitted to an acute rehabilitation hospital were screened, and 106 patients were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Recruited patients were stratified using Montebello Rehabilitation Factor Score (MRFS) efficiency. We selected the top (n = 20, 19%) and bottom (n = 20, 19%) of MRFS efficiency for metabolomic analysis. A total of 21 serum amino acids levels were measured using ultra high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The normalized data were analyzed by multivariate approaches, and the selected potential biomarkers were combined in different combinations for prediction of stroke functional recovery. The results demonstrated that there were significant differences in leucine-isoleucine, proline, threonine, glutamic acid, and arginine levels between good and poor recovery groups. In the training (0.952) and test (0.835) sets, metabolite biomarker panels composed of proline, glutamic acid, and arginine had the highest sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing good recovery from poor. In particular, arginine was present in the top 10 combinations of the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) test set. Our findings suggest that amino acids related to energy metabolism and excitotoxicity may play an important role in functional recovery after stroke. Therefore, the level of serum arginine has predictive value for the recovery rate after stroke.",

However, most stroke patients receive comprehensive treatment that not only includes BCI, but also routine training. The purpose of this study was to investigate the topological alterations in brain functional networks following comprehensive treatment, including BCI training, in the subacute stage of stroke. Twenty-five hospitalized subacute stroke patients with moderate to severe UL paralysis were assigned to one of two groups: 4-week comprehensive treatment, including routine and BCI training (BCI group, BG, n = 14) and 4-week routine training without BCI support (control group, CG, n = 11). Functional UL assessments were performed before and after training, including, Fugl-Meyer Assessment-UL (FMA-UL), Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), and Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT). Neuroimaging assessment of functional connectivity (FC) in the BG was performed by resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. After training, as compared with baseline, all clinical assessments (FMA-UL, ARAT, and WMFT) improved significantly (p < 0.05) in both groups. Meanwhile, better functional improvements were observed in FMA-UL (p < 0.05), ARAT (p < 0.05), and WMFT (p < 0.05) in the BG. Meanwhile, FC of the BG increased across the whole brain, including the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes and subcortical regions. More importantly, increased inter-hemispheric FC between the somatosensory association cortex and putamen was strongly positively associated with UL motor function after training. Our findings demonstrate that comprehensive rehabilitation, including BCI training, can enhance UL motor function better than routine training for subacute stroke patients. The reorganization of brain functional networks topology in subacute stroke patients allows for increased coordination between the multi-sensory and motor-related cortex and the extrapyramidal system. Future long-term, longitudinal, controlled neuroimaging studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of BCI training as an approach to promote brain plasticity during the subacute stage of stroke.",

Several trials have demonstrated that dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), &#946;-blocker, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor and statin therapy improve the prognosis in patients with obstructive myocardial infarction (ob-MI). However, evidence on the best medical therapy for secondary prevention in MINOCA patients is lacking.\nTo investigate the effects of secondary prevention treatments at discharge on mid-term outcomes in MINOCA.\nPatients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) undergoing early coronary angiography between 2016 and 2018 were extracted from a clinical database. The diagnosis of MINOCA was made according to 2016 ESC MINOCA Position Paper criteria. Second-level diagnostic work-up including cardiac magnetic resonance was performed to exclude non-ischemic troponin elevation cause. The relationship between treatments and outcomes was evaluated by using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression models. All confirmed MINOCA were followed in our outpatient clinics. The primary end-points were all-cause mortality, re-hospitalization for MI and a composite outcome including all-cause mortality, hospitalization for MI and ischemic stroke (MACE).\nOut of 1,141 AMI who underwent coronary angiography, 134 were initially diagnosed as MINOCA. Patients with MINOCA were less likely to receive secondary prevention treatments than patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) MI (respectively, 42.1% vs 81.8% for DAPT; 75.5% vs 89.6% for &#946;-blockers; 64.7% vs 80.3% for RAAS inhibitor and 63.9% vs 83% for statins). Based on the diagnostic work-up completed during the first month after discharge, a final sample of 88 patients had confirmed MINOCA. During an average follow-up of 19.35 &#177; 10.65 months, all-cause mortality occurred in 11 (12.5%) patients, recurrence of MI in 4 (4.5%), and MACE in 15 (17.0%) patients. Patients treated with RAAS inhibitors and statins had a significantly longer survival. On the contrary, no increase in survival was found in patients treated with &#946;-blockers or DAPT. Cox multivariable analysis, including all secondary prevention drugs, showed that only RAAS inhibitors were associated with reduced all cause-mortality and MACE.\nThis prospective study suggests that RAAS inhibitor therapy provides mid-term beneficial effects on outcomes in MINOCA patients; in contrast, dual antiplatelet, &#946;-blocker and statin therapy had no effects on mortality and MACE. These results should be considered preliminary and warrant confirmation from larger studies.",

These data demonstrate the time-activity curve of drugs in the brain subregions and their spatial distribution in different organs after intrathecal administration. Furthermore, agrin treatment effectively inhibits BBB disruption by reducing the loss of tight-junctional proteins. Importantly, the infarct volume is reduced; the number of apoptotic neurons is decreased; and neurological function is improved in mouse I/R injury models. Thus, intrathecal injection of agrin provides the basis for a new strategy to research and develop protein drugs for reducing the aggravation of I/R injury.",

However, in paroxysmal AF patients, expensive long-term rhythm monitoring might be necessary to detect the arrhythmia. In the present article, the authors describe an algorithm, constructed by artificial intelligence and big data, to detect a 'footprint' of AF on a 12-lead ECG during sinus rhythm. However, despite this promising premise, the algorithm comes from a 'black-box' calculation and, therefore, it cannot rule out possible bias from medication or patient characteristics. Furthermore, the combination of a moderate test specificity and a low prevalence of only 10% undetected AF in the post-stroke population, results in a low positive predictive value, which is not useful for initiation of anticoagulation therapy.",

        "abstract": "\nThe prevalence of functional movement disorders is 2 to 3 times higher in women than in men. Trauma and adverse life events are important risk factors for developing functional movement disorders. On a population level, rates of sexual abuse against women are higher when compared with the rates against men.\nTo determine gender differences in rates of sexual abuse in functional movement disorders compared with other neurologic disorders and evaluate if the gender prevalence is influenced by higher rates of sexual abuse against women.\nWe performed a case-control series including 199 patients with functional movement disorders (149 women) and 95 controls (60 women). We employed chi-squared test to assess gender and sexual abuse associations and Bayes formula to condition on sexual abuse.\nOur analysis showed an association between sexual abuse and functional movement disorders in women (odds ratio, 4.821; 95% confidence interval, 2.089-12.070; P&#8201;<&#8201;0.0001), but not men. Bayesian analysis found the functional movement disorder prevalence ratio between women and men conditional on sexual abuse to be 4.87 times the unconditioned ratio.\nThere is a statistically significant association between sexual abuse and functional movement disorders in women and a greater likelihood that women who are sexually abused will develop functional movement disorders than men who are sexually abused. Our findings suggest that the increased prevalence of functional movement disorders in women is associated, at least in part, with sexual abuse and its sequelae; however, further research is needed to explore the role of other traumatic and nontraumatic factors.",

This study investigated the incidence and mode of stroke recurrence in patients with a history of stroke who underwent atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation.\nOf 825 patients who underwent AF ablation from 2006 to 2016, 77 patients (9.3%, median age 69&#160;years) with a prior ischemic stroke were identified. Patients were classified as those with prior cardioembolic (CE) stroke (n&#160;=&#160;55) and those with prior non-CE stroke (n&#160;=&#160;22). The incidence and pattern of stroke recurrence were investigated.\nThe incidence of asymptomatic AF (54.5% vs 22.7%; P&#160;=&#160;.011) and left atrial volume (135.8&#160;mL vs 109.3&#160;mL; P&#160;=&#160;.024) was greater in the CE group than in the non-CE group. Anticoagulation treatment was discontinued at an average of 28.1&#160;months following the initial ablation in 34 (44.2%) patients. None of the patients developed CE stroke during a median 4.1-year follow-up. In the non-CE group, 2 patients experienced recurrent non-CE stroke (lacunar infarction in 1 and atherosclerotic stroke in 1); however, AF was not observed at the onset of recurrent ischemic stroke.\nIn patients with a history of stroke who underwent catheter ablation for AF, the incidence of recurrent stroke was 0.54/100 patient-years. The previous stroke in these patients may not have been due to AF in some cases; therefore, a large-scale prospective study is warranted to identify the appro priate antithrombotic therapy for the prevention of potentially recurrent stroke.",

Cardiac abnormalities included myocardial abnormalities (atrial or ventricular dilation, hypertrophy, hypokinesis, and impaired relaxation), decreased ejection fraction > 10%, and valvular abnormalities (thickening or stenosis of the valve leaflets). Breast laterality (left vs. right) and heart radiation dose volume parameters were analyzed for association with cardiac imaging abnormalities.\nA total of 110 patients with 57 left- and 53 right-sided breast cancers were evaluated. Overall, 37 patients (33.6%) developed a new cardiac abnormality. Left-sided radiotherapy was associated with an increase in new cardiac abnormalities (relative risk [RR]&#160;= 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.34-4.67; P&#160;= .002). Both myocardial and valvular abnormalities were associated with left-sided radiotherapy (myocardial: RR&#160;= 2.21; 95% CI, 1.06-4.60; P&#160;= .029; valvular: RR&#160;= 3.30; 95% CI, 0.98-10.9; P&#160;= .044).

In this chapter we critically review some of the literature on the use of robots in rehabilitation, and emphasize the diversity of approaches in this burgeoning field. We argue that there is a need to consolidate interdisciplinary evidence on robotics and rehabilitation in a systematic way, as the alternative is to have a literature that continues to grow, following the interests of various specialists, but without offering a synoptic assessment of what is available to medical specialists and patients. A literature review using Scopus and Web of Science, coupled with the Briggs Institute's Critical Appraisal Tool: Checklist for Case Reports was conducted. The two databases were systematically searched using inter-disciplinary keywords in Feb 2019. An initial search of the databases produced 9894 articles. After rigorous reviews, 35 articles were screened and selected for further interpretation. We examined the current studies on the efficiency and effectiveness of the robot interventions and produced a taxonomy of the review. An original finding of the current robotics in rehabilitation landscaping are critical presented with recommendations and concluding remarks concerning interdisciplinary impact.",

        "abstract": "\nReal time hand movement trajectory tracking based on machine learning approaches may assist the early identification of dementia in ageing Deaf individuals who are users of British Sign Language (BSL), since there are few clinicians with appropriate communication skills, and a shortage of sign language interpreters. Unlike other computer vision systems used in dementia stage assessment such as RGBD video with the aid of depth camera, activities of daily living (ADL) monitored by information and communication technologies (ICT) facilities, or X-Ray, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images fed to machine learning algorithms, the system developed here focuses on analysing the sign language space envelope (sign trajectories/depth/speed) and facial expression of deaf individuals, using normal 2D videos. In this work, we are interested in providing a more accurate segmentation of objects of interest in relation to the background, so that accurate real-time hand trajectories (path of the trajectory and speed) can be achieved. The paper presents and evaluates two types of hand movement trajectory models. In the first model, the hand sign trajectory is tracked by implementing skin colour segmentation. In the second model, the hand sign trajectory is tracked using Part Affinity Fields based on the OpenPose Skeleton Model [1, 2]. Comparisons of results between the two different models demonstrate that the second model provides enhanced improvements in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness of tracking. The pattern differences in facial and trajectory motion data achieved from the presented models will be beneficial not only for screening of deaf individuals for dementia, but also for assessment of other acquired neurological impairments associated with motor changes, for example, stroke and Parkinson's disease.",

Methods: This study is based on China Kadoorie Biobank. Anthropometric indexes were objectively measured at the baseline survey during 2004-2008. After excluding participants with heart disease, stroke, cancer, COPD and diabetes, 428 113 participants aged 30 to 79 years were included in the analysis. Cox regression models were used to investigate the associations of BMI and waist circumference with incidence of major chronic diseases (including cardiovascular disease, cancer, COPD, and type 2 diabetes) and all-cause mortality. Results: Over an average of 10 years, 131 454 participants developed any one of major chronic diseases. A total of 26 892 all-cause deaths were reported. The risk of major chronic diseases increased with BMI. Compared with normal BMI (18.5-24.0 kg/m(2)), the HR (95%CI) of overweight (BMI 24.0-28.0 kg/m(2)) and obesity (BMI&#8805;28.0 kg/m(2)) were 1.26 (95%CI: 1.24-1.27) and 1.59 (95%CI: 1.57-1.62) respectively. Underweight and obesity were both associated with risk of all-cause mortality. Waist circumference was positively associated with risk of major chronic diseases and all-cause mortality. According to recommended cut-off points of BMI and waist circumference for Chinese adults, maintaining a healthy body weight would prevent 12% incident cases of major chronic diseases. Conclusion: General and central obesity were risk factors for major chronic disease among Chinese adults.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: This large-scale, double-blind, randomized controlled trial with a 1-year follow-up enrolls patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients are randomly assigned 1:1 into either the high-dose TxA group (intravenous bolus [30 mg/kg] after anesthesia followed by intravenous maintenance [16 mg/kg/h] throughout the operation, and a pump prime dose of 2 mg/kg) or the low-dose TxA group (intravenous bolus and maintenance are 10 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg/h, respectively, and a pump prime dose of 1 mg/kg). The primary efficacy end point is the rate of perioperative allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion defined as the number (%) of patients who will receive at least 1 RBC unit from operation day to discharge. The primary safety end point is the 30-day rate of the composite of perioperative seizures, renal dysfunction, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and all-cause mortality. The secondary end points are perioperative allogeneic RBC transfusion volume, the non-RBC blood transfusion rate, postoperative bleeding, reoperation rate, mechanical ventilation duration, intensive care unit stay, hospital length of stay, total hospitalization cost, each component of composite primary safety end point, and the 6-month/1-year follow-up mortality and morbidity.

We evaluated the impact of individual (age, gender and education) and township (geographic area, socioeconomic status, background air pollution and road density) level factors on the relationship between short-term variation in PM2.5 with cause-specific mortality in Beijing (population: 21.7 million in 2016), China.\nDaily PM2.5 concentrations in each township (n&#160;=&#160;327; township population: 2000-359,400; township area: 1-392&#160;km2) within Beijing were estimated by kriging with external drift using measurements from 35 air quality monitoring stations and geographic variables. Time-stratified case-crossover analysis with township-level mortality data from Oct. 1st, 2012 to Dec. 31st, 2013 was then used to examine associations between PM2.5 exposure estimates and cause-specific mortality, stratified by the potential effect modifiers.\nA 10-&#956;g/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration was associated with a 0.17% [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05%-0.29%] and 0.27% (95%CI:0.01%-0.52%) increase in non-accidental and stroke mortality with no lag, a 0.81% (95%CI:0.39%-1.23%) and 0.96% (95%CI:0.35%-1.57%) increase in respiratory disease (RD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mortality at a lag of two-day moving average. For individual-level effect modifiers, the elderly showed higher effects for all the specific causes of mortality; those with lower education level showed higher effects for non-accidental, cardiovascular disease and stroke mortality; females showed higher effects for non-accidental and cause-specific cardiovascular diseases. For township-level effect modifiers, effect estimates tended to be larger for suburban areas, areas of lower road density, lower PM2.5 and lower socioeconomic status.\nShort-term exposure to township-level ambient PM2.5 was associated with increased mortality in Beijing, with indications of effect modification by both individual and township-level factors.",

The World Health Organization 5-Item Wellbeing-Index (WHO-5), the Major Depression Inventory, and the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory were used. Patients were genotyped according to serotonin-transporter gene polymorphisms. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify potential predictors of poor wellbeing (WHO-5 score <50). Overlap between wellbeing, fatigue, and depression was examined using an Euler diagram.\nWe included 919 patients. The prevalence of poor wellbeing was 279 (30.4%) six months after stroke. Living alone at stroke onset was the strongest predictor of poor wellbeing with a mutually adjusted odds ratio of 1.53 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03 to 2.28) at one month and 1.77 (CI: 1.13 to 2.76) at six months. Severe stroke at admission also predicted poor wellbeing at six months. Abnormal fatigue occurred in half and incorporated almost all patients with poor wellbeing. Less than 5% fulfilled the criteria for depression at any point and almost all of these patients had poor wellbeing and abnormal fatigue. Antidepressants were used by 292 (31.8%) during follow-up.\nCognitive impairment was not measured and could interact with wellbeing post-stroke.\nLiving alone strongly predicted poor wellbeing after stroke.

Unlike many other anticoagulant agents, it does not need periodic monitoring. However, monitoring is still required to determine the risk of bleeding due to overdose or surgery. Usually, apixaban concentrations are indirectly quantified using an anti-factor Xa assay. However, this method has a relatively narrow analytical concentration range, poor selectivity, and requires an external calibrator. Therefore, the goal of current study was to establish an analytical method for determining plasma levels of apixaban using ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). To this end, apixaban was separated using 2.5 mM ammonium formate (pH 3.0) (A) and 100% methanol containing 0.1% formic acid (B) using the gradient method with a Thermo hypersil GOLD column. The mass detector condition was optimized using the electrospray ionization (ESI) positive mode for apixaban quantification. The developed method showed sufficient linearity (coefficient of determination [r2 &#8805; 0.997]) at calibration curve ranges. The percentage (%) changes in accuracy, precision, and all stability tests were within 15% of the nominal concentration. Apixaban concentration in plasma from healthy volunteers was quantified using the developed method. The mean maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was 371.57 ng/mL, and the median time to achieve the Cmax (Tmax) was 4 h after administration of 10 mg apixaban alone. Although the results showed low extraction efficiency (~16%), the reproducibility (% change was within 15% of nominal concentration) was reliable. Therefore, the developed method could be used for clinical pharmacokinetic studies.",

Subsets of participants also completed additional measures of pain region, pain intensity, quality of life, pain interference and physical function.\nIncreased features of centralized pain by age were seen for the WPI (r=0.27, p<0.01) and SS scale (r=0.29, p<0.01). Expected differences in sex were seen for the WPI (sex:t132=-3.62, p<0.01), but not the SS scale (sex:t223=-1.73, p=0.09). Reliability for the SS scale was adequate (&#945;=.70). Construct validity was demonstrated through relationships between the WPI and pain regions (r=.57, p<0.01), and between the SS scale and quality of life (r=-.59, p<0.01) and pain interference (r=.56, p<0.01). Criterion validity was demonstrated by differences on the WPI between the surgery sample and the headache and chronic pain samples (F2,237=17.55, p<0.001). Comprehension of the SS scale items was problematic for some youth.\nThe WPI showed adequate psychometric properties in youth; however the SS scale may need to be modified.

        "abstract": "\nBackground and Objective: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is considered a preclinical state of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may represent a more advanced preclinical status than amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Our aim was to explore changes in the white matter (WM) microstructure and their correlation with cognitive function in these AD-spectrum patients. Methods: Diffusion tensor images from 43 individuals with normal cognition (NC), 38 SCD patients, and 36 aMCI patients were compared using an atlas-based segmentation strategy. The correlation between diffusion parameters and cognitive function was further analyzed. Results: The anatomical pattern of WM impairment was generally similar between SCD and aMCI patients. However, aMCI patients showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy (i.e., corpus callosum forceps major and forceps minor) and increased mean diffusivity [i.e., bilateral anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), left corticospinal tract (CST), forceps minor, left cingulum (cingulate gyrus), left cingulum hippocampus, and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFO)] in some tracts than did SCD subjects, indicating a disruption in WM microstructural integrity in the aMCI. Individuals with microstructural disruption in forceps minor, left cingulum (cingulate gyrus), and left cingulum hippocampus tracts performed worse in general cognition and memory function tests, as indicated by line regression analysis. Conclusion: SCD individuals had extensive WM microstructural damage in a pattern similar to that seen in aMCI, although presenting a cognitive performance comparable with that of cognitively healthy individuals. Our results suggest that WM integrity might precede objectively measurable memory decline and may be a potential early biomarker for AD.",

        "abstract": "\nLeukoaraiosis (LA), widely accepted as a feature of cerebral small vessel disease, significantly increases the incidence of stroke, dementia, and death. Cerebral small artery disease has been considered as one of the main causes of LA. However, since the term \"venous collagenosis\" (VC) was proposed in an atrophy research in 1995, there have been pathological and neuroimaging studies proving the association between the venous system and LA in aging, Alz-heimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease.\nAutopsy studies confirmed that thickening of the lumen wall in venules, which results from the deposition of collagen I and III, leading to vessel stenosis or occlusion, is closely associated with LA. Susceptibility-weighted imaging research revealed a controversial association of deep medullary veins and LA in vivo, regarding which there are no standard criteria currently. Nevertheless, retinal venous changes had been reported to increase the risk of LA development, providing a novel way for in vivo evaluation. As for the internal jugular vein, jugular venous reflux could double the LA score in aging and modulate circulation of cerebral spinal fluids. Key Messages: Disruption of the venous system was notably associated with LA in aging, AD, and Parkinson's disease post-mortem and in in vivo models. The venous pathological changes may induce cerebral hypoperfusion, drainage system disruption, and vasogenic oedema in the veins around the periventricular white matter. The clarification of VC in LA may provide an early prevention and early treatment strategy for LA patients.",

Accordingly, in the most recent European Society of Cardiology guidelines the role of routine TA during PPCI has been downgraded to a class III recommendation with level A of evidence. On the other hand, it has been suggested that in case of high thrombus burden a selective use of TA may still play a role. STEMI due to cardioembolism (CE) definitely represents one of these situations. In the present case of an 81-year-old woman presenting with STEMI due to a cardioembolic obstruction of left main coronary artery, we show that TA succeeded, whereas classical angioplasty failed, in promoting a prompt coronary flow restoration in a life-threatening condition. Further, it allowed us not to upgrade the procedure with stent implantation that would have required a triple antithrombotic therapy, significantly increasing the bleeding risk. Visual examination of thrombi retrieved suggested the diagnosis of CE. Finally, we clearly show which is the mechanism linking TA with the risk of stroke. <Learning objective: Recent European Society of Cardiology guidelines have downgraded thrombus aspiration (TA) in the setting of ST-T segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) to a class III recommendation with level A of evidence.

Age-standardized prevalence was 2.98% (3.42% for male and 2.69% for female). The results identified that old age, female, smoking, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were positively associated with CHD. Being Female and a higher level of physical activity were negatively related to stroke, while old age, high-risk drinking, and chronic disease were positively related to stroke. Conclusion: CHD and stroke were not rare in Chinese rural area. Healthy lifestyles and control of chronic disease should be improved to curb the epidemic of cardiovascular disease among rural population.

        "abstract": "\nStroke ranks the second leading cause of death among people over the age of 60 in the world. Stroke is widely regarded as a complex disease that is affected by genetic and environmental factors. Evidence from twin and family studies suggests that genetic factors may play an important role in its pathogenesis. Therefore, research on the genetic association of susceptibility genes can help understand the mechanism of stroke. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has found a large number of stroke-related loci, but their mechanism is unknown. In order to explore the function of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the molecular level, in this paper, we integrated 8 GWAS datasets with brain expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) dataset to identify SNPs and genes which are related to four types of stroke (ischemic stroke, large artery stroke, cardioembolic stroke, small vessel stroke). Thirty-eight SNPs which can affect 14 genes expression are found to be associated with stroke. Among these 14 genes, 10 genes expression are associated with ischemic stroke, one gene for large artery stroke, six genes for cardioembolic stroke and eight genes for small vessel stroke. To explore the effects of environmental factors on stroke, we identified methylation susceptibility loci associated with stroke using methylation quantitative trait loci (MQTL). Thirty-one of these 38 SNPs are at greater risk of methylation and can significantly change gene expression level. Overall, the genetic pathogenesis of stroke is explored from locus to gene, gene to gene expression and gene expression to phenotype.",

        "abstract": "\nAcute ischemic stroke, especially minor stroke, and transient ischemic attack have high risks of recurrence and exacerbation into severe ischemic strokes. It remains challenging to perform risk stratification and screen high-risk groups for initiation of early treatment in these patients. Moreover, with the growing population of patients with chronic small vessel disease, the mechanisms and clinical implications require further investigation. Traditional tools such as the ABCD2 score (age, blood pressure, clinical features, duration of symptoms, diabetes) have only moderate predictive value in patients with transient ischemic attack or minor stroke. By contrast, measurement of changes in heart rate variability (HRV) is an important and novel tool for risk stratification and outcome prediction in patients with cardiovascular diseases, as it reflects the overall level of autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Thus, abnormal HRV may be useful for prognosis and improve stratification of stroke patients with diverse risks. HRV may also partially explain autonomic nervous dysfunction and other manifestations during the process of chronic cerebral small vessel disease. In summary, measurement of HRV may contribute to early initiation of interventions in acute or chronic stroke patients using novel treatments involving rebalancing of autonomic nervous system function.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground: After a Stroke, there is an autonomic nervous system (ANS) changes. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) can promote the reorganization of the affected circuits. Objective: To evaluate the effects of tDCS applied before a session of physical activity on the treadmill, in the modulation of the autonomic nervous system of post-stroke patients. Methodology: Cross-over study, were randomized 12 adult hemiparetic subjects in 2 groups, Group 1 (active tDCS before exercise on the treadmill) and Group 2 (sham tDCS before exercise on the treadmill). Stimulation times were 20 min; treadmill time was 20 min. The heart rate variability (HRV) and Variability of Systolic Blood Pressure (VSBP) were evaluated for 15 min, in 3 periods (pre and post tDCS and during exercise recovery on the treadmill). Results: There was no difference in the VSBP and the HRV between the groups, compared with the baseline data; however, in the intragroup analysis, the parasympathetic modulation after active tDCS increased by 18% over baseline by the RMSSD with IC 95% (-7.85 to -0.34). In group 1, the post-tDCS active and post-exercise periods presented a value of variance above baseline, indicating a better prognosis. In group 2, there was a significant reduction of 38% of Variance values (p = 0.003) after tDCS sham. Conclusion: tDCS does not generate immediate effects on HRV and VSBP, except for intragroup comparison, which has greater participation in parasympathetic modulation in the group receiving active tDCS.",

The goal of this study was to investigate the feasibility of incorporating a fast-track, long term continuous heart monitoring (LTCM) program within a stroke clinic. Method: We designed and implemented a fast-track LTCM program in our stroke clinics. The instrument that we used for the study was the ZioXT&#174; device from IRhythm&#8482; Technologies. To implement the program, all clinic support staff received training on the skin preparation and proper placement of the device. We prospectively followed every patient who had a request from one of our inpatient or outpatient stroke or neurology providers to receive LTCM. We recorded patients' demographics, the LTCM indication, as well as related quality measures including same-visit placement, wearing time, analyzable time, LTCM application to the preliminary finding time, as well as patients' out of pocket cost. Results: Out of 501 patients included in the study, 467 (93.2%) patients (mean age 65.9 &#177; 13; men: 48%) received LTCM; and 92.5% of the patients had the diagnosis of stroke or TIA. 93.7% of patients received their LTCM during the same outpatient visit in the stroke clinic. The mean wearing time for LTCM was 12.1 days (out of 14 days). The average analyzable time among our patients was 95.0%. Eighteen (3.9%, 95%CI: 2.4-6.0) patients had at least one episode of PAF that was sustained for more than 30 s. The rate of PAF was 5.9% (95% CI: 3.5-9.2) among patients with the diagnosis of stroke. Out of 467 patients, 392 (84%) had an out-of-pocket cost of < $100.

        "abstract": "\nBackground and Purpose: Primary stroke center (PSC) certification is associated with improvements in stroke care and outcome. However, these improvements may reflect a higher baseline level of care delivery in hospitals eventually achieving certification. This study examines whether advancements in acute stroke care at PSCs are due to certification or factors intrinsic to the hospital. Methods: Data was obtained from the Field Administration of Stroke Therapy-Magnesium (FAST-MAG) trial with participation of 40 Emergency Medical System agencies, 315 ambulances, and 60 acute receiving hospitals in Los Angeles and Orange Counties. Subjects were transported to one of three types of destinations: PSC certified hospitals (PSCs), hospitals that were not PSCs at time of enrollment but would later become certified (pre-PSCs), and hospitals that would never be certified (non-PSCs). Metrics of acute stroke care quality included time arrival to imaging, use of intravenous tPA, and arrival to treatment. Results: Of 1,700 cases, 856(50%) were at certified PSCs, 529(31%) were at pre-PSCs, and 315 (19%) were at non-PSCs. Mean (SD) was 33min (&#177;76.1) at PSCs, 47(&#177;86.6) at pre-PSCs, and 49(&#177;71.7) at non-PSCs. Of 1,223 cerebral ischemia cases, rate of tPA utilization was 43% at PSCs, 27% at pre-PSCs, and 28% at non-PSCs. Mean ED arrival to thrombolysis was 71(&#177;32.7) at PSC, 98(&#177;37.6) at pre-PSC, and 95(&#177;45.0) at non-PSCs. PSCs had improved time to imaging (p = 0.014), percent tPA use (p < 0.001), and time to treatment (p = 0.003).

However, evidence on the safety and efficacy of MT in elderly patients compared with younger patients is controversial. This meta-analysis is aimed to systematically compare the outcomes of elderly patients and younger patients after MT for AIS. Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted through the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library database. The primary outcomes were favorable functional outcome at 90 days and mortality. The secondary outcomes were symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) and successful recanalization rate. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using a random effects model. Results: Sixteen studies published between 2014 and 2019 were included in this meta-analysis totally involving 3,954 patients. The pooled results showed that patients aged &#8805;80 years had worse functional outcome (OR = 0.40; 95% CI, 0.32-0.50; P < 0.001) and higher rates of mortality (OR = 2.26; 95% CI, 1.73-2.95; P < 0.001). There was a trend of higher rates of sICH in patients aged &#8805;80 years compared with patients aged <80 years, whereas this did not reach statistical significance (OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 0.89-1.84; P = 0.18). Furthermore, the frequency of successful recanalization was also lower in patients aged &#8805;80 years compared with patients aged <80 years (OR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55-0.95; P = 0.02). The subgroup analysis indicated that in comparison with those studies published between 2014 and 2016, elderly patients undergoing MT had better outcomes in studies published between 2017 and 2019. Conclusion: Elderly patients undergoing MT had higher risk of mortality and worse functional outcome. Meanwhile, there was a trend toward higher rates of sICH and lower probability of achieving successful recanalization in elderly patients. These findings emphasize the need for improving the rates of successful recanalization in elderly patients with AIS. In addition, advanced technology of endovascular intervention and peri-interventional management might be associated with the prognosis in elderly patients.

In this study, we examine risk factors and consequences of intravenous rt-PA for treatment of acute ischemic stroke. In a retrospective cohort study we evaluate risk factors for seizure and epilepsy after stroke thrombolysis, as well as the impact of seizures and epilepsy in outcome of stroke patients. In our cohort, mean age of patients was 67.2 years old (SD = 13.1) and 79 of them (51.6%) were male and. Initial NIHSS mean score were 10.95 (SD = 6.25). Three months NIHSS mean score was 2.09 (SD = 3.55). Eighty seven (56.9%) patients were mRS of 0-1 after thrombolysis. Hemorrhagic transformation was observed in 22 (14.4%) patients. Twenty-one (13.7%) patients had seizures and 15 (9.8%) patients developed epilepsy after thrombolysis. Seizures were independently associated with hemorrhagic transformation (OR = 3.26; 95% CI = 1.08-9.78; p = 0.035) and with mRS &#8805; 2 at 3 months after stroke (OR = 3.51; 95% CI = 1.20-10.32; p = 0.022).

We chose leukocyte count as a marker of inflammatory response and investigated whether the effects of leukocyte count on the clinical outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients are different according to different factors. Methods: We derived data from the China National Stroke Registry II. Patients with ischemic stroke were classified into four groups by leukocyte count quartiles within the first 24 h after admission. Adverse clinical outcomes were defined as recurrent stroke, all-cause death, and poor functional outcomes (3 &#8804; mRS &#8804; 5) at 3-months and 1-year follow-up. The subgroup factors were age, sex, history of hypertension, history of diabetes, history of previous stroke, or transient ischemic attack and smoking status. We assessed the association between leukocyte count and adverse clinical outcomes and evaluated this association in different subgroups. Results: A total of 14,678 patients were included. Patients in higher quartiles were likely to be younger, male, smokers, and drinkers, and to have a shorter time from symptom onset to arrival, a more proportion of history of diabetes, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension, and a higher severity of stroke. Higher quartiles were associated with elevated risk of adverse clinical outcomes at 3-months and 1-year follow-up. Leukocyte count had a moderate accuracy to predict clinical outcomes. There was no difference in the relationship between leukocyte count and adverse clinical outcomes across subgroups such as age, sex, history of hypertension, and smoking. The effect of leukocyte count on all-cause death was pronounced among patients with previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, and the effect of leukocyte count on short-term poor functional outcomes was also pronounced among patients without diabetes. Conclusions: Leukocyte count is associated with short-term and long-term clinical outcomes of acute ischemic stroke and may have predictive value, especially in patients with certain specific characteristics.",

Extracellular matrix (ECM) and yes-associated protein (YAP) expression may play essential roles in the pathophysiology of carotid artery stenosis, but the effect of blood flow disturbances of carotid bifurcation location on the ECM is unknown. We hypothesized that carotid artery anatomy and geometry are independently associated with the ECM and YAP expression.\nIn this cross-sectional study, 193 patients were divided into two groups: an asymptomatic group (n = 111) and a symptomatic group (n = 82), symptomatic patients presenting with ischemic attack, amaurosis fugax, or minor non-disabling stroke. For all subjects before surgery, carotid bifurcation angle and internal artery angle were measured with computed tomography angiography (CTA), and laminar shear stress was measured with ultrasonography. After surgery, pathology of all plaque specimens was analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and Movat special staining. Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect expression of YAP in a subset of 30 specimens.\nSymptomatic patients had increased carotid bifurcation angle and laminar shear stress compared to asymptomatic patients (P < 0.05), although asymptomatic patients had increased internal carotid angle compared to symptomatic patients (P < 0.001). Relative higher bifurcation angles were correlated with increased carotid bifurcation, decreased internal angle, and decreased laminar shear stress. For each change in intervertebral space or one-third of vertebral body height, carotid bifurcation angle changed 4.76&#176;, internal carotid angle changed 6.91&#176;, and laminar shear stress changed 0.57 dynes/cm2. Pathology showed that average fibrous cap thickness and average narrowest fibrous cap thickness were greater in asymptomatic patients than symptomatic patients (P < 0.05). Expression of proteoglycan and YAP protein in symptomatic patients was higher than in asymptomatic patients (P < 0.001), while collagen expression was lower in symptomatic patients than asymptomatic patients (P < 0.05).\nGeometry of the carotid artery and position relative to cervical spine might be associated with ECM and YAP protein expression, which could contribute to carotid artery stenosis.",

Recurrent syncope has a devastating impact on quality of life and is challenging to manage effectively. To blunt orthostatic fluid shifts, static calf compression garments are often prescribed to patients with syncope, but have questionable efficacy. Intermittent calf compression, which mimics the skeletal muscle pump to minimize pooling and filtration, holds promise for the management of syncope. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of intermittent calf compression for increasing orthostatic tolerance (OT; time to presyncope). We conducted a randomized single-blind crossover study, in which participants (n = 21) underwent three graded 60&#176; head-up-tilt tests to presyncope with combined lower body negative pressure on separate days. Low frequency intermittent calf compression (ICLF; 4 s on and 11 s off) at 0-30 and 0-60 mmHg was applied during two tests and compared to a placebo condition where the garment was fitted, but no compression applied. We measured continuous leg circumference changes (strain gauge plethysmography), cardiovascular responses (finger plethysmography; Finometer Pro), end tidal gases (nasal cannula), and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFv, transcranial Doppler). The 0-60 mmHg ICLF increased OT (33 &#177; 2.2 min) compared to both placebo (26 &#177; 2.4 min; p < 0.001) and 0-30 mmHg ICLF (25 &#177; 2.7 min; p < 0.001). Throughout testing 0-60 mmHg ICLF reduced orthostatic fluid shifts compared to both placebo and 0-30 mmHg ICLF (p < 0.001), with an associated improvement in stroke volume (p < 0.001), allowing blood pressure to be maintained at a reduced heart rate (p < 0.001). In addition, CBFv was higher with 0-60 mmHg ICLF than 0-30 mmHg ICLF and placebo (p < 0.001). Intermittent calf compression is a promising novel intervention for the management of orthostatic intolerance, which may provide affected individuals renewed independence and improved quality of life.",

Dl-NBP has been shown to promote neurological functional recovery and enhance white matter integrity using an endothelin-1-induced focal permanent cerebral ischemia model, which could mimic those patients who have no opportunity to receive either tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) thrombolysis or endovascular therapy. However, it is not clear whether dl-NBP could promote neurological functional recovery in a focal transient cerebral ischemia model, which could mimic those patients who have the opportunity to receive either tPA thrombolysis or endovascular therapy. In this study, using a model of middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice, we aim to explore the effect of two-week dl-NBP treatment on neurological functional recovery after ischemic stroke as well as its underlying mechanism. Our results showed that dl-NBP treatment promoted functional recovery assessed by neurological scores and an adhesive remove test, and this improved the integrity of white matter after 60-min ischemia and 14-day reperfusion. In addition, dl-NBP increased the number of RECA-1 positive vessels and enhanced the expression of the tight junction protein occludin. More importantly, dl-NBP also promoted the expression of hypoxia-induced factor-1&#945;, the vascular endothelial growth factor, Notch, and delta-like ligand 4. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that dl-NBP treatment could also promote functional recovery after focal transient ischemia stroke, and this recovery is associated with upregulated white matter integrity, microvessels, and the tight junction protein occludin. Our results suggested that, in future, dl-NBP may also be applied in clinic to promote functional recovery during the later phase of focal transient ischemic stroke.",

Here we report that Kang Le Xin (KLX), a novel anthraquinones compound, could reduce blood pressure and the underlying mechanisms involves that KLX induces endothelium-dependent vasodilation. KLX significantly decreases the arterial blood pressure of spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR), decreases the contractile reactivity of superior mesenteric artery to phenylephrine and increases the vasodilatory reactivity of superior mesenteric artery to carbachol in a dose-dependent manner. Besides, KLX reduces vascular tension of endothelium-intact mesenteric artery pre-constricted with phenylephrine in a dose-dependent manner, while this effect is inhibited by depriving vascular endothelium or pretreating vascular rings with L-NAME (endothelial nitric oxide synthase inhibitor) or compound C (AMP-activated protein kinase inhibitor). Moreover, KLX increases nitric oxide (NO) generation, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), AKT and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), while these effects are inhibited by pretreating cells with compound C. In conclusion, KLX is a new compound with the pharmacological action of reducing arterial blood pressure.

In this intervention, paretic stroke patients receive online feedback about their brain activity while conducting a motor-imagery (MI) task with the paretic limb. Typically, the feedback provided in NF-MIT protocols is an abstract visual signal based on a fixed trial. Here we developed a self-paced NF-MIT paradigm with an embodiable feedback signal (EFS), which was designed to resemble the content of the mental act as closely as possible. To this end, the feedback was delivered via an embodiable, anthropomorphic robotic hand (RH), which was integrated into a closed-looped EEG-based brain-computer interface (BCI). Whenever the BCI identified a new instance of a hand-flexion or hand-extension imagination by the participant, the RH carried out the corresponding movement with minimum delay. Nine stroke patients and nine healthy participants were instructed to control RH movements as accurately as possible, using mental activity alone. We evaluated the general feasibility of our paradigm on electrophysiological, subjective and performance levels. Regarding electrophysiological measures, individuals showed the predicted event-related desynchronization (ERD) patterns over sensorimotor brain areas. On the subjective level, we found that most individuals integrated the RH into their body scheme. With respect to RH control, none of our participants achieved a high level of control, but most managed to control the RH actions to some degree. Importantly, patients and controls achieved similar performance levels. The results support the view that self-paced embodiable NF-MIT is feasible for stroke patients and can complement classical NF-MIT.",

        "title": "Visual Exploration Area in Neglect: A New Analysis Method for Video-Oculography Data Based on Foveal Vision.",
        "abstract": "\nVideo-oculography during free visual exploration (FVE) is a valuable tool to evaluate visual attention spatial allocation in neglect patients after right-hemispheric stroke. In conventional FVE analyses, the position of a visual fixation is conceived as a single point in space. Here, we describe a new complementary method to analyze FVE data based on foveal vision, leading to an accurate estimate of the portion of the picture that was effectively explored. In 15 neglect patients and 20 healthy controls, visual exploration areas (i.e., considering 1&#176; visual angle around every single fixation) were computed. Furthermore, the proportion of single and overlapping fixations was analyzed. Overlapping fixations were further categorized into capture fixations (successive overlapping fixation, putatively reflecting problem of disengagement) and re-capture fixations (temporally distant overlapping fixations, putatively reflecting spatial working memory deficits). The results of this new analysis approach were compared to the ones of conventional approaches. Conventional analyses showed the typical visual attention deficits in neglect patients versus healthy controls: significantly less fixations and time spent within the left and significantly more fixations and time spent within the right screen half. According to the results of our new approach, patients showed a significantly smaller visual exploration area within the left screen half. However, the right visual exploration area did not differ between groups. Furthermore, in neglect patients, the proportion of overlapping fixations within the right screen half was significantly higher than within the left screen half, as well as significantly higher than in healthy controls within either screen halves. Whereas neglect patients showed significantly more capture fixations than healthy controls, the number of re-capture fixations did not differ between groups. These results suggest that, in neglect patients, the efficiency of visual exploration is also reduced within the right screen half and that impaired disengagement might be an important mechanism leading to overlapping fixations. Our new analysis of the visual exploration area, based on foveal vision, may be a promising additional approach in visual attention research. It allows to accurately measure the portion of the picture that was effectively explored, disentangle single from overlapping fixations, and distinguish between capture and re-capture fixations.",

        "abstract": "\nWe hypothesized that a single-leg version of the Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) system could improve the gait and physical function of patients with hemiparesis following a stroke. In this pilot study, we therefore compared the efficacy of HAL-based gait training with that of conventional gait training (CGT) in patients with acute stroke. Patients admitted to the participating university hospital were assigned to the HAL group, whereas those admitted to outside teaching hospitals under the same rehabilitation program who did not use the HAL were assigned to the control group. Over 3 weeks, all participants completed nine 20 min sessions of gait training, using either HAL (i.e., the single-leg version of HAL on the paretic side) or conventional methods (i.e., walking aids and gait orthoses). Outcome measures were evaluated before and after the nine training sessions. The Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) was the primary outcome measure, but the following secondary outcome measures were also assessed: National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Fugl-Meyer Assessment (Lower Extremity), comfortable walking speed, step length, cadence, 6-min walk distance, Barthel Index, and Functional Independence Measure. In total, 22 post-stroke participants completed the clinical trial: 12 in the HAL group and 10 in the CGT group. No serious adverse events occurred in either group. The HAL group showed significant improvement in FAC after nine sessions when compared with the CGT group (P = 0.014). However, secondary outcomes did not differ significantly between the groups. Our results demonstrate that HAL-based gait therapy may improve independent walking in patients with acute stroke hemiplegia who are dependent on ambulatory assistance. A larger-scale randomized controlled trial is needed to clarify the effectiveness of single-leg HAL therapy. Clinical Trial Registration: UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, identifier UMIN000022410.",

[Participants and Methods] Forty patients with hemiplegia who developed a non-functional hand on the paretic side after one year or more of stroke and 25 asymptomatic controls were included. To obtain the CSA of the median nerve at the wrist in the neutral position and the LSL of the median nerve during wrist extension, the participants underwent bilateral ultrasound examination. [Results] The non-paretic side of stroke patients had the largest median nerve CSA, followed by the paretic side and then the controls; the median nerve CSA in the non-paretic side and the controls differed significantly. The CSA of the median nerve was significantly larger in the non-paretic sides of patients, evaluated at more than 5.5&#8197;years post-stroke relative to those evaluated at less than 5.5&#8197;years. The LSL of the paretic side was significantly shorter than the non-paretic side and the controls. [Conclusion] Compared to the controls, the CSA of the median nerve was enlarged in the non-paretic hand of ambulant chronic stroke patients and the LSL were identical. As such, entrapment neuropathy of the median nerve may follow long-term chronic stroke due to overuse. This study indicates the usefulness of ultrasound in the potential identification of such cases.",

With more than 1700 implantations worldwide, the Syncardia temporary TAH is the most commonly used pump. Globally, it represents 2% of the long-term mechanical circulatory support devices implanted, with a recent decrease in its use. The main candidates for TAH are heart transplant candidates suffering from acute or decompensated chronic irreversible biventricular failure at high risk of imminent death and for whom a suitable donor is not available. Most patients receiving a TAH are acutely ill, characterized by an INTERMACS profile of 1 or 2, and 20% are under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The TAH provides efficient circulatory support and allows the end-organ to recover from the initial hypoperfusion injury. More than 60% of patients implanted with a Syncardia TAH will later undergo transplantation, with a 1-year survival rate of 70% after transplantation, compared with a 1-year survival rate of &#8764; 42% in nontransplant patients. Bleeding, infection, stroke, and acute kidney injury are the most common complications in this critically ill population. The new miniaturization of the console (Freedom Portable Driver) facilitates the recovery of TAH recipients by allowing ambulation, aggressive physiotherapy, and, eventually, hospital discharge. This last aspect is one of the main benefits of TAH compared with other biventricular assist devices. In conclusion, the Syncardia temporary TAH is a reasonable bridge-to-transplant option for selected patients with either biventricular failure or special anatomic conditions.",

Furthermore, a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies was performed to investigate pooled associations of SUA with all-cause and cause-specific mortality.\nVital status through December 31, 2011 was ascertained. PubMed-Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were searched (up to April 2018). Adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to determine the association between SUA and mortality. The DerSimonian-Laird method and generic inverse variance methods were used for quantitative data synthesis.\nOverall, 21,025 individuals were included (mean age&#8239;=&#8239;47.6 years, 48.7% men) and 3520 deaths occurred during the 144 months of follow-up. In adjusted models, individuals in the highest quartile of SUA had 10 and 8% greater risk of CHD and stroke mortality, whereas there was no link between SUA, all-cause and cancer mortality. The associations of CHD and stroke mortality with SUA were more pronounced in women and, among women, in those aged >50 years. Furthermore, all-cause mortality was positively and significantly related to SUA concentrations only in women. In the meta-analysis, SUA was shown to predict the risk of total (21%), CHD (24%) and stroke (29%) mortality. Furthermore, participants with a higher level of central adiposity had a greater risk of mortality from CHD and stroke for the same level of SUA.\nOur results highlight the adverse impact of SUA on mortality, particularity in older (>50 years) women.

Modern rehabilitation includes both traditional techniques for recovery of patients with motor deficit (exercise therapy and physiotherapy) and botulinum therapy, kinesiotherapy, mechanotherapy, etc., which have been developed in recent years. Robotic technologies have been developed, improved, and implemented. Currently, due to progress in computerization, virtual reality-based rehabilitation of patients is of particular interest.

Nevertheless, many consider the correction of PE a cosmetic intervention, with post-operative changes ascribed to the concurrent growth of the young patient population. No studies have investigated non-invasively the immediate cardiac changes following relief of the deformity. The aim of this study was to assess cardiac function before and during temporary sternal elevation using the non-invasive vacuum bell (VB) device on young adults with PE.\nAdult patients scheduled for surgical correction of PE underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) before and during the application of the VB. Steady-state free precession sequences were used for the evaluation of biventricular volume and function. Phase contrast sequences measured the aortic and pulmonary flow to calculate stroke index (SI). Scans were analyzed post hoc by the same investigator. A control group of healthy individuals was assessed in the same way.\nIn total, 20 patients with PE (mean age 23&#177;10 years) and 10 healthy individuals (mean age 25&#177;6 years) underwent CMR before and during VB application. Before intervention, baseline cardiac volumes and function were similar between the groups, with patient-values in the low-to-normal range. Following VB application, PE patients revealed a 10% increase in biventricular SI. Furthermore, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index (LV EDVI) improved by 8% and right ventricular ejection fraction (RV EF) increased by 7%. These findings were not mirrored in the healthy individuals. No correlations were found between improved cardiac parameters and the baseline Haller index (HI) of PE patients.\nNon-invasive, momentary correction of PE is associated with an immediate improvement in SI, RV EF and LV EDVI, not observed in controls. The findings suggest that sternal depression in PE patients affects cardiac function.",

Factors independently associated with ICU stay or surgical intervention were age >65 years (OR 0.38, 95%&#8201;CI 0.21 to 0.69), GCS <15 (1.23, 95%&#8201;CI 1.01 to 1.52) and ICH score >0 (OR 2.23, 95%&#8201;CI 1.70 to 2.91).\nAmong this cohort of primary patients with ICH, GCS of 15 and ICH score of 0 were associated with less frequent use of ICU or intervention. These results should be validated in a larger sample but may be valuable for hospitals considering which patients with ICH could safely remain at the referring facility.",

        "title": "Understanding cost data collection tools to improve economic evaluations of health interventions.",
        "abstract": "\nMicro-costing data collection tools often used in literature include standardized comprehensive templates, targeted questionnaires, activity logs, on-site administrative databases, and direct observation. These tools are not mutually exclusive and are often used in combination. Each tool has unique merits and limitations, and some may be more applicable than others under different circumstances. Proper application of micro-costing tools can produce quality cost estimates and enhance the usefulness of economic evaluations to inform resource allocation decisions. A common method to derive both fixed and variable costs of an intervention involves collecting data from the bottom up for each resource consumed (micro-costing). We scanned economic evaluation literature published in 2008-2018 and identified micro-costing data collection tools used. We categorized the identified tools and discuss their practical applications in an example study of health interventions, including their potential strengths and weaknesses. Sound economic evaluations of health interventions provide valuable information for justifying resource allocation decisions, planning for implementation, and enhancing the sustainability of the interventions. However, the quality of intervention cost estimates is seldom addressed in the literature. Reliable cost data forms the foundation of economic evaluations, and without reliable estimates, evaluation results, such as cost-effectiveness measures, could be misleading. In this project, we identified data collection tools often used to obtain reliable data for estimating costs of interventions that prevent and manage chronic conditions and considered practical applications to promote their use.",

White matter microvascular integrity represents one risk factor for poor long-term functional outcomes after ischaemic stroke. The aim of the study is to characterise sex-specific differences in microvascular integrity in individuals with acute ischaemic stroke.\nA retrospective analysis of subjects with acute ischaemic stroke and brain MRI with diffusion-weighted (DWI) and dynamic-susceptibility contrast-enhanced (DSC) perfusion-weighted imaging obtained within 9&#8201;hours of last known well was performed. In the hemisphere contralateral to the acute infarct, normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) microvascular integrity was measured using the K 2 coefficient and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. Regression analyses for predictors of K 2 coefficient, DWI volume and good outcome (90-day modified Rankin scale (mRS) score <2) were performed.\n105 men and 79 women met inclusion criteria for analysis. Despite no difference in age, women had increased NAWM K 2 coefficient (1027.4 vs 692.7&#215;10-6/s; p=0.006). In women, atrial fibrillation (&#946;=583.6; p=0.04) and increasing NAWM ADC (&#946;=4.4; p=0.02) were associated with increased NAWM K 2 coefficient. In multivariable regression analysis, the K 2 coefficient was an independent predictor of DWI volume in women (&#946;=0.007; p=0.01) but not men.\nIn women with acute ischaemic stroke, increased NAWM K 2 coefficient is associated with increased infarct volume and chronic white matter structural integrity.

Stroke mechanism, collateral circulation, and degree and length of stenosis were analysed. The primary outcome was time from index event to new transient ischaemic attack (TIA), acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) or death. Other outcome variables included modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score on discharge and last follow-up.\nOf 6369 patients with AIS/TIA, 91 (1.43%) had ISBAS. Seventy-three (80.2%) patients presented with AIS and 18 (19.8%) with TIA. Twenty-nine (31.9%) were women and the median age was 66.8&#177;13.6 years. The mean follow-up time was 2.7 years. The most common stroke mechanism was artery-to-artery thromboembolism (45.2%), followed by perforator occlusion (28.7%) and flow-dependent/hypoperfusion (15.1%). The percentage of stenosis was lower in patients who had favourable outcome compared with those with mRS 3-6 on discharge (78.3&#177;14.3 vs 86.9&#177;14.5, p=0.007). Kaplan-Meier curves showed higher recurrence/death rates in patients with &#8805;80% stenosis, mid-basilar location and poor collateral circulation. Approximately 13% of patients with ISBAS presented with complete BA occlusion.\nISBAS is an uncommon (1.43%) cause of TIA and AIS.

Some indicators, like cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume (SV) and other parameters were used to evaluate cardiac function. Literature search, quality evaluation and data extraction were conducted independently by two authors. The tailored Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) was used for literature quality evaluation. EndNote X6 was used for literature screening and management. RevMan 5.3 was used for Meta-analysis. Funnel chart analysis was used for publication bias.\nA total of 26 studies involving 772 patients were included. Among them, there were 5 literatures found that the agreements of cardiac function between the USCOM and TD methods were poor. Meta-analysis showed that there was no significant difference between the two methods in CO and CI monitoring [CO: mean difference (MD) = -0.06, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was -0.17 to 0.05, P = 0.31; CI: MD = -0.04, 95%CI was -0.13 to 0.05, P = 0.38].

According to whether or not mild hypothermia was provided, they were divided into the normal thermic group (NT group) and mild hypothermia treatment group (MHT group). The MHT group patients were matched with the NT group patients by the propensity score matching method at a ratio of 1:1. The observation period was within the first 7 days after admission. Baseline characteristics including age, gender, type of stroke, comorbidities, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score and Glasgow coma score (GCS) on admission, surgical operation, dysphagia, invasive procedures and outcomes of these patients had been analyzed. The primary outcome was incidence of post-stroke infection, and the secondary outcomes included the time of initial infection (TII, the duration from stroke to initial infection), hospital mortality, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) at discharge, incidence of complications such as arrhythmia, coagulation dysfunction and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).\n201 stroke patients were enrolled, 41.8% (84/201) of whom underwent mild hypothermia.

        "abstract": "\nEvidence on sex differences in the association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and cardiovascular outcomes is limited and controversial. We conducted a historical cohort study to investigate this relationship.\nClinical data on adults who underwent sleep study at a large urban academic hospital (Toronto, Canada) between 1994 and 2010 were linked to provincial health administrative data from 1991 to 2015. We fit Cox regressions to investigate the association between OSA severity and a cardiovascular composite outcome (all-cause mortality or hospitalization due to myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure or atrial fibrillation), controlling for risk factors and stratifying by sex.\nA total of 10,149 subjects were included: median age of 49 years, 38% women. Over a median of 9.3 years, 1782 (18%) participants developed an outcome. The association between percentage of sleep time spent with oxygen saturation <90% and outcome was stronger for women (HR for IQR, 3 vs 0%&#160;=&#160;1.30, 1.19-1.42) than for men (HR for IQR&#160;=&#160;1.13, 1.06-1.21) (p for interaction&#160;=&#160;0.01) in the adjusted model. Stratifying by sex, oxygen desaturations and heart rate in sleep were significant predictors in both men and women, while presence of daytime sleepiness, sleep efficiency and periodic leg movements in sleep were predictive in women but not in men.\nIn a large clinical cohort with suspected OSA, the impact of OSA as measured by the degree of nocturnal oxygen desaturation on the composite outcome was found to be greater in women than in men. We also found a different predictive ability of OSA-related factors by sex.",

However, few reports have described non target encephalic embolization, detailing its temporal evolution.\nA 41-year-old man presented with a massive hemorrhage in the oral cavity due to an arteriovenous malformation involving the left hemiface and tongue. Under conscious sedation, selective angiography was followed by endovascular embolization with a mixture of n-butyl-cyanoacrylate-methacryloxy-sulfolane (NBCA-MS) with Lipiodol. The hemorrhage was successfully arrested, but the procedure was complicated with a reflux of embolic material from the right external carotid artery into the common carotid, caused by strong unexpected coughing. Non-target embolization was confirmed by emergency CT and subsequent MRI. After initial neurological impairment, the patient recovered fully and was discharged after one week. No sequelae were confirmed by 9-months follow-up with CT and MRI. We describe technical aspects, multimodality imaging, clinical presentation, and follow-up of this peculiar case.\nEndovascular embolization of AVM fed by the external carotid is at risk for non-target brain embolization and general anesthesia should be considered to prevent inadvertent movements and master the delivery of the embolic agent A small amount of Lipiodol / NBCA-MS may be fully tolerated by the brain matter and partially reabsorbed without permanent deficit.",

The findings were consistent with Sung, et al.(5) that medication nonadherence are prevalent in young adults with a firstever stroke. The results by Chen, et al.(4) highlighted the importance of developing strategies to improve antithrombotic adherence. Besides, the risk-benefit profile of medication treatment must be considered and monitored for optimizing prescription in secondary stroke prevention. For those purposes, real-world data (RWD) derived from administrative claims database is becoming an efficient source of information.(6) The US Food and Drug Administration has also recognized the use of RWD to monitor post-marketing safety and adverse events and to make regulatory decisions of medicinal products.(7) Nonetheless, deriving RWD from administrative claims database should be held to an even higher scientific standard because of the greater potential for bias.(6) For example, the ascertainment of cases, coding for comorbidities, and handling of unmeasured confounders (e.g. disease severity) should follow those previously wellvalidated methods.(8-10) Besides, we should note that the adherence measured using claims data is the proportion of days covered with filled prescription. It might not be exactly equal to the real medication adherence behavior of the patients, as mentioned by Chen, et al.(4) Linking administrative claims database with other validated clinical databases (e.g. stroke registry) may improve the validity of a RWD study.(11) In the era of data science and artificial intelligence, we neurologists should endeavor to make the best use of all available electronic healthcare datasets, creating more useful RWD for our patients with strokes, as well as other neurological diseases.",

The Surpass Streamline device (Stryker Neurovascular, MI, USA) is a relatively new and unique flow diverting stent which maintains constant device mesh density over varying vessel diameters. This may potentially provide advantages compared to other flow diverting stents in achieving aneurysmal occlusion.\nTwo patients with VRAA were treated using the Surpass Streamline device. The first patient was a 65-year-old male with an incidental 2.4&#8201;cm aneurysm originating from the hepatic artery near the gastroduodenal artery (GDA). The second patient was a 56-year-old male with an incidental 1.9&#8201;cm renal aneurysm arising from an anterior inferior segmental branch of the left renal artery. A Surpass flow diverting stent was used to successfully exclude the aneurysm neck in both cases. Reduced flow was achieved in one patient (equivalent to O'Kelly-Marotta [OKM] Grade B1). Preserved flow and stagnation (equivalent to OKM Grade A3) was achieved in the other. There was preserved distal flow in the parent arteries. No immediate complications were encountered in either case. Complete occlusion of both aneurysms was seen on follow up CT angiographic imaging within 8-weeks.\nThe Surpass flow diverting stent can be used safely and effectively to treat VRAA. It should be considered in unruptured large and giant wide necked VRAAs aneurysms. Additional large prospective studies are required for further validation.",

        "title": "Learning unsupervised contextual representations for medical synonym discovery.",
        "abstract": "\nAn important component of processing medical texts is the identification of synonymous words or phrases. Synonyms can inform learned representations of patients or improve linking mentioned concepts to medical ontologies. However, medical synonyms can be lexically similar (\"dilated RA\" and \"dilated RV\") or dissimilar (\"cerebrovascular accident\" and \"stroke\"); contextual information can determine if 2 strings are synonymous. Medical professionals utilize extensive variation of medical terminology, often not evidenced in structured medical resources. Therefore, the ability to discover synonyms, especially without reliance on training data, is an important component in processing training notes. The ability to discover synonyms from models trained on large amounts of unannotated data removes the need to rely on annotated pairs of similar words. Models relying solely on non-annotated data can be trained on a wider variety of texts without the cost of annotation, and thus may capture a broader variety of language.\nRecent contextualized deep learning representation models, such as ELMo (Peters et&#160;al., 2019) and BERT, (Devlin et al. 2019) have shown strong improvements over previous approaches in a broad variety of tasks. We leverage these contextualized deep learning models to build representations of synonyms, which integrate the context of surrounding sentence and use character-level models to alleviate out-of-vocabulary issues. Using these models, we perform unsupervised discovery of likely synonym matches, which reduces the reliance on expensive training data.\nWe use the ShARe/CLEF eHealth Evaluation Lab 2013 Task 1b data to evaluate our synonym discovery method. Comparing our proposed contextualized deep learning representations to previous non-neural representations, we find that the contextualized representations show consistent improvement over non-contextualized models in all metrics.\nOur results show that contextualized models produce effective representations for synonym discovery. We expect that the use of these representations in other tasks would produce similar gains in performance.",

We present a unique case of reactivation disseminated histoplasmosis in an immunocompetent patient. We present a case of a 75-year-old male who presented to the ER on two separate occasions for stroke-like symptoms with progressive falls, impaired speech, hand tremor, confusion and generalized weakness. CT of the head without contrast on both occasions showed chronic atrophy and microvascular changes but no acute abnormalities. MRI could not be performed due to pacemaker incompatibility. EKG showed paced rhythm. The only abnormal lab was a creatinine level&#160;of 1.6. Neurology was consulted and they ordered an EEG and lumbar puncture during his second hospitalization. EEG showed generalized slowing, suggestive of diffuse brain dysfunction. Lumbar puncture showed WBC: 103, protein: 172, lymphocytes: 88%, neutrophils: 11%, monocytes: 1%. Following the lumbar puncture, Infectious Disease was consulted. On further investigation, it was discovered that the patient was previously treated for oral histoplasmosis with itraconazole for three months. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was positive for histoplasmosis antigen titer 1:64. Serology was positive for histoplasmosis antibody complement fixation titer of 1:32.

The patient was discharged home on itraconazole 200 mg for lifetime, due to his previous history of oral histoplasmosis. On his three-month follow-up, his serology titer was <1:8. Histoplasmosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients who present with chronic meningitis, cerebral vascular accident, focal brain or spinal cord lesions, and encephalitis.",

Cardiac biometrics and Doppler-echocardiographic parameters for evaluation of fetal heart function, including cardiac output and stroke volume, can be analyzed using M-mode, two-dimensional (2D), and 3D/4D cardiac ultrasound. In recent years, functional echocardiography has been used to study fetuses without a structurally cardiac defect but who are at risk of heart failure due to the presence of extra-cardiac conditions, such as, fetal growth restriction, tumors/masses, twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, fetal anemia (Rh alloimmunization), congenital infections, or maternal diabetes mellitus. The assessment of cardiac function provides important information on hemodynamic status and can help optimize the best time for delivery and reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality. Since 2003, with the advent of the 4D-STIC software, it is possible to evaluate the fetal heart in multiplanar, and rendering modes. This technology associated with virtual organ computer-aided analysis (VOCAL) enables determining the ventricular volume (end-diastole, end-systole), the stroke-volume, the ejection fraction, and the cardiac output of each ventricle. Since 2004, several studies demonstrated that the 4D-STIC and VOCAL had good reproducibility to measure cardiac volumes This study reviews published studies that evaluated the fetal cardiac function by 3D ultrasound using 4D-STIC and VOCAL software.",

In-hospital SAP was defined as a complication that occurred after stroke, during hospitalization, that was confirmed radiographically. Serum vitamin D levels were measured within 24&#160;hrs of admission and the patients were divided into vitamin D sufficient (>50 nmol/L), insufficient (25-50 nmol/L), and deficient (<25 nmol/L) groups.\nIn this study, 102 (11.8%) patients were diagnosed with SAP. Compared to the patients without SAP, patients with SAP had significantly lower vitamin D levels (P = 0.023). The incidence of SAP was significantly higher in patients with vitamin D deficiency than in those with vitamin D insufficiency or sufficiency (21.2% vs 16.2% & 9.5%, P = 0.006). After adjusting for confounders, vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were independently associated with SAP (OR = 3.034, 95% CI = 1.207-7.625, P = 0.018; OR = 1.921, 95% CI = 1.204-3.066, P = 0.006, respectively). In multiple-adjusted spline regression, vitamin D levels showed a linear association with the risk of SAP (P < 0.001 for linearity).\nReduced vitamin D is a potential risk factor of in-hospital SAP, which can help clinicians identify high-risk SAP patients.",

        "abstract": "\n&#8195;Endovascular stent grafting has emerged as an option to treat traumatic aorta injuries with reported significantly low mortality and morbidity. Stent collapse is one of the complications that can occur in this type of treatment. The aim of this article is to analyze the expected cause of stent collapse and to draw attention to the importance of the surveillance follow-up, as this phenomenon may occur late postdeployment.\n&#8195;A retrospectively collected dataset from the two highest volume trauma centers in Saudi Arabia was analyzed between April 2007 and October 2012. A total of 66 patients received stent grafts for traumatic aortic injury and were included in the study. We apply Ishimaru's anatomical aortic arch zones and Benjamin's aortic injury grading systems. There were 35 patients with aortic injury at zone 2, 26 patients in zone 3, and 5 patients in zone 4. About 96% (63) of the injuries were grades 2 and 3, including large intimal flap or aortic wall pseudoaneurysm with change in wall contour. The technical success rate, as defined by complete exclusion of lesions without leaks, stroke, arm ischemia or stent-related complications, was 90%.\n&#8195;Proximal stent collapse occurred in 4.5% of patients (3 of 66 inserted stents) during follow-up of 4 to 8 years (mean, 6 years). Patients with stent collapse tended to have an acute aortic arch angle with long-intraluminal stent lip, when compared with patients with noncollapsed stents. Intraluminal lip protrusion more than 10-mm increased collapse (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). Stent-grafts sizes larger than 28&#8201;mm also demonstrated a higher collapse rate (p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001).\n&#8195;The risk of stent collapse appears related to poor apposition of the stent due to severe aortic arch angulation in young patients and to large stent sizes (>28&#8201;mm). Such age groups may have more anatomical and aortic size changes during the growth. Clinical and radiological surveillance is essential in follow-up after stent-graft treatment for traumatic aortic injury.",

Current therapies are ineffective in reducing CVSPs, but a a combination of dantrolene and nimodipine may be a viable treatment. Considering the potentially harmful secondary effects of dantrolene, however, we evaluated the efficacy of 10&#160;&#956;M dantrolene compared to 50&#160;&#956;M dantrolene alone or in combination with 50&#160;nM nimodipine.\nDose-response curves for the phenylephrine (PHE)-induced contraction and acetylcholine (ACh)-induced relaxation were performed on aortic rings from diabetic and non-diabetic rats, before and after a 30-min incubation period with dantrolene (50&#160;&#956;M and 10&#160;&#956;M), alone or in combination with 50&#160;nM nimodipine.\nWhereas 50&#160;&#956;M dantrolene reduced PHE-induced contraction by 47% in diabetic rats and 29% in controls, 10&#160;&#956;M dantrolene failed to reduce this parameter in either group.

Physical exercise has shown to be neuroprotective in both animal experiments and clinical settings. Exercise can be considered a mild stressor and follows the prototypical preconditioning stimulus. It has beneficial effects on brain health and cognitive function. Preconditioning exercise, which is prophylactic exercise prior to ischemia, can protect the brain from subsequent serious injury through promotion of angiogenesis, mediation of inflammatory responses, inhibition of glutamate over-activation, protection of the blood-brain barrier, and inhibition of apoptosis. Preconditioning exercise appears to induce brain ischemic tolerance and it has been shown to exert beneficial effects. It is clinically safe and feasible and represents an exciting new paradigm in endogenous neuroprotection for patients with acute stroke.

However, in patients with imperative indications for nephron-sparing surgery a kidney resection with thrombectomy in rare situations is possible. We present a surgical technique for nephron-sparing surgery in patients with tumor spreading into the main renal vein. From 2007 to 2019 seven partial nephrectomies with removal of the tumor thrombus from the main renal vein were performed. Absolute imperative indications were recorded in 6 (85.7%) patients (4 with solitary kidney, 2 with bilateral tumors). Dimensions of renal tumor averaged 6.5&#177;2.3 cm. Intravenous part of the tumor penetrated the initial portion of the renal vein in 3 cases, main trunk of the renal vein in 3 cases, and cavarenal portion of the IVC in 1 case. The average length of the tumor thrombus was 24.0&#177;6.9 mm, and the width was 9.3&#177;4.8 mm. Tumor thrombi were classified as intrarenal and extrarenal. In accordance with this principle surgical procedures were divided into partial nephrectomy with intrarenal (3/42.9%) and extrarenal thrombectomy (4/57.1%). Intrarenal thrombectomy was characterized by thrombus removal out of the vein lumen from the side of the kidney resection area, while extrarenal thrombectomy included additional opening the lumen of the main renal vein or inferior vena cava (IVC). In one patient hypothermic perfusion of the kidney in situ was used. In two cases the extracorporeal partial nephrectomy with kidney autotransplantation was performed. Warm ischemia time averaged 14.0 minutes. The time of ischemia during hypothermic perfusion in situ reached 76 minutes, the time of cold ischemia during extracorporeal surgery averaged 68.0 minutes. The volume of blood loss did not exceed an average of 621.4&#177;146.8 ml. Early postoperative complications occurred in 4 (57.1%) cases (bleeding -1, ischemic stroke -1, deterioration of renal failure -2). Postoperative mortality was registered in 1 patient due to bleeding and heart failure. The follow-up period averaged 28.7&#177;18.9 months. Distant metastases occurred in 1 (14.3%) patient after 16 months. Local tumor recurrence in the remnant kidney after nephron-sparing surgery was not detected in any case. Nephron-sparing surgery may be used to treat patients with kidney tumors and neoplastic venous thrombosis. However, this complex surgical approach requires further technical improvement.",

This patient with a history of three strokes presented to our facility with new left facial droop. Neurological examination revealed left facial droop and hemiparesis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) described right frontal lobe acute ischemia. Head computed tomography (CT) angiography revealed bilateral supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusions. Cerebral angiography demonstrated diffuse intracranial vascular irregularity with stenosis, more above the bilateral supraclinoid ICAs and the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) suggestive of moyamoya disease. Due to the lack of MCA patency, he underwent EDAS. Superficial temporal artery (STA) was dissected inferiorly and the posterior branch was bipolared, then STA was movable. A bur hole made at the superior and inferior portion along the STA. Dura was opened, and STA was brought on top of the pia. His facial droop gradually improved after that. Nine months later, no new strokes reported. Moyamoya disease is a rare neurovascular disorder characterized by narrowing and occlusion of the ICA branches. Its symptoms include recurrent ischemic/hemorrhagic strokes. Incidence in Hispanics has not been studied. The gap between the first manifestations and disease progression is one to eight years. Its diagnosis is often delayed. Our patient had recurrent strokes for five years. Despite therapy with antiplatelets, new ischemic stroke brought him to our institution. Rate of recurrent strokes despite antiplatelets was reported 10.3% per year. Brain CTs and MRIs had failed to detect strokes' etiology. Catheter-directed angiography is the gold standard test for diagnosis of moyamoya disease. Antiplatelet alone is ineffective and surgery is the effective method to prevent further strokes, although there are no studies in adults regarding the efficacy of indirect revascularization. In direct revascularization, usually STA anastomoses to MCA. Indirect method works through the development of leptomeningeal collaterals. Postoperative complications are infarction and hyperperfusion syndrome. Seong-eun et al. proposed that modified EDAS is simpler with less complications in comparison with direct revascularization. Some other studies showed higher chance of stroke in indirect method versus direct technique. In conclusion, it is important to consider moyamoya disease as a differential diagnosis in patients with recurrent strokes.",

        "abstract": "\nPropagation-based X-ray phase-contrast imaging (PBI) is a powerful nondestructive imaging technique that can reveal the internal detailed structures in weakly absorbing samples. Extending PBI to CT (PBCT) enables high-resolution and high-contrast 3D visualization of microvasculature, which can be used for the understanding, diagnosis and therapy of diseases involving vasculopathy, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke and tumor. However, the long scan time for PBCT impedes its wider use in biomedical and preclinical microvascular studies. To address this issue, a novel CT reconstruction algorithm for PBCT is presented that aims at shortening the scan time for microvascular samples by reducing the number of projections while maintaining the high quality of reconstructed images. The proposed algorithm combines the filtered backprojection method into the iterative reconstruction framework, and a weighted guided image filtering approach (WGIF) is utilized to optimize the intermediate reconstructed images. Notably, the homogeneity assumption on the microvasculature sample is adopted as prior knowledge, and therefore, a prior image of microvasculature structures can be acquired by a k-means clustering approach. Then, the prior image is used as the guided image in the WGIF procedure to effectively suppress streaking artifacts and preserve microvasculature structures. To evaluate the effectiveness and capability of the proposed algorithm, simulation experiments on 3D microvasculature numerical phantom and real experiments with CT reconstruction on the microvasculature sample are performed. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can, under noise-free and noisy conditions, significantly reduce the artifacts and effectively preserve the microvasculature structures on the reconstructed images and thus enables it to be used for clear and accurate 3D visualization of microvasculature from few-projection data. Therefore, for 3D visualization of microvasculature, the proposed algorithm can be considered an effective approach for reducing the scan time required by PBCT.",

        "abstract": "\nS-allyl-L-cysteine (SAC) is a sulfur-containing amino acid present in garlic and exhibits a wide range of biological activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer agent. An earlier study demonstrated that SAC ameliorates oxidative damage in a model of experimental stroke. However, the antioxidant property of SAC does not suffice to explain its beneficial effects in terms of the underlying mechanisms. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ER stress-induced cell death have been shown to be involved in various neurological diseases such as brain ischemia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Huntington's disease. We have previously demonstrated that SAC exerts significant protective effects against ER stress-induced neurotoxicity in cultured rat hippocampal neurons and organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Recently, we demonstrated that these results are due to the direct suppression of calpain activity via the binding of SAC to this enzyme's Ca2+-binding domain. We also found that the protective effects of the side-chain-modified SAC derivatives, S-ethyl-L-cysteine (SEC) and S-propyl-L-cysteine (SPC), against ER stress-induced neurotoxicity were more potent than those of SAC in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. In addition, SAC, SEC and SPC have been shown to decrease the production of amyloid-&#946; peptide in the brains of mice with D-galactose-induced aging. These three hydrophilic cysteine-containing compounds have also been shown to exert neuroprotective effects against dopaminergic neuron injury in a murine model of Parkinson's disease induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). In this review, we aim to provide a current overview of the protective actions of SAC and the SAC-related compounds, SEC and SPC, in neurodegenerative disease and discuss the promise of SAC as a prototype for developing novel therapeutic drugs for neurological diseases.",

A total of 129 patients with senile cerebrovascular occlusion admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University from August 2015 to September 2017 were collected. Among them, 69 patients who underwent neurointerventional catheter thrombolysis under 3D-DSA were included in the study group, and 60 patients treated with neurointerventional thrombolysis were the control group. The levels of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1&#946; and IL-8 in the two groups were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) before treatment (T0), 7 days (7d) after treatment (T1) and 14 days (14d) after treatment (T2). The score of the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale and the clinical efficacy of patients in the two groups were compared before and after treatment, and Barthel index (BI) was used for investigation before and after treatment. The recurrence rate of disease in the two groups within 1 year was recorded. At T1, IL-6, IL-1&#946; and IL-8 in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P<0.05). The NIHSS score in the study group was lower than that in the control group after treatment (P<0.05). The BI score in the study group was significantly higher than that in the control group after treatment (P<0.05). After the prognostic follow-up, the disease recurrence rate of the study group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P<0.05). In conclusion, 3D-DSA combined with neurointerventional thrombolysis can significantly reduce the expression of inflammatory cytokines and improve the quality of life in patients with cerebrovascular occlusion, which has a high clinical value.",

        "abstract": "\nRisk of the development of multiple sclerosis (MS) is known to be increased in individuals bearing distinct class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) variants, whereas some of them may have a protective effect. Here we analyzed distribution of a highly polymorphous HLA-DRB1 locus in more than one thousand relapsing-remitting MS patients and healthy individuals of Russian ethnicity. Carriage of HLA-DRB1*15 and HLA-DRB1*03 alleles was associated with MS risk, whereas carriage of HLA-DRB1*01 and HLA-DRB1*11 was found to be protective. Analysis of genotypes revealed the compensatory effect of risk and resistance alleles in trans. We have identified previously unknown MBP153-161 peptide located at the C-terminus of MBP protein and MBP90-98 peptide that bound to recombinant HLA-DRB1*01:01 protein with affinity comparable to that of classical antigenic peptide 306-318 from the hemagglutinin (HA) of the influenza virus demonstrating the ability of HLA-DRB1*01:01 to present newly identified MBP153-161 and MBP90-98 peptides. Measurements of kinetic parameters of MBP and HA peptides binding to HLA-DRB1*01:01 catalyzed by HLA-DM revealed a significantly lower rate of CLIP exchange for MBP153-161 and MBP90-98 peptides as opposed to HA peptide. Analysis of the binding of chimeric MBP-HA peptides demonstrated that the observed difference between MBP153-161, MBP90-98, and HA peptide epitopes is caused by the lack of anchor residues in the C-terminal part of the MBP peptides resulting in a moderate occupation of P6/7 and P9 pockets of HLA-DRB1*01:01 by MBP153-161 and MBP90-98 peptides in contrast to HA308-316 peptide. This leads to the P1 and P4 docking failure and rapid peptide dissociation and release of empty HLA-DM-HLA-DR complex. We would like to propose that protective properties of the HLA-DRB1*01 allele could be directly linked to the ability of HLA-DRB1*01:01 to kinetically discriminate between antigenic exogenous peptides and endogenous MBP derived peptides.",

        "abstract": "\nIntroduction: The aging of the western population and the increased use of oral anticoagulation (OAC) and antiplatelet drugs (APD) will result in a clinical dilemma on how to balance the recurrence risk of chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) with the risk of withholding blood thinners. Objective: To identify features that predicts recurrence, thromboembolism (TEE), hospital stay and mortality. To identify the optimal window for resuming APD or OAC. Methods: We performed a retrospective multivariate analysis of a prospectively collected database. We then build machine learning models for outcomes prediction. Results: We identified 596 patients. The rate of recurrence was 22.17%, that of thromboembolism was 0.9% and that of mortality was 14.78%. Smoking, platelet dysfunction, CKD, and alcohol use were independent predictors of higher recurrence, while resolution of the SDH was protective. OAC use had higher odds of developing TEEs. CKD, developing a new neurological deficit or a TEEs were independent predictors of higher mortality. We find the optimal time of resuming OAC to be after 2 days but before 21 days as these patients had the lowest recurrence of bleeding associated with a low risk of stroke. The ML model achieved an accuracy of 93, precision of 0.84 and recall of 0.80 for recurrence prediction. ML models for hospital stay performed poorly (R 2 = 0.33). ML model for stroke was overfitted given the low number of events. Conclusion: ML modeling is feasible. However, large well-designed prospective multicenter studies are needed for accurate ML so that clinicians can balance the risks of recurrence with the risk of TEEs, especially for high-risk anticoagulated patients.",

        "abstract": "\nIntroduction: Ischemic stroke remains one of the most debilitating diseases and is the fifth leading cause of death in the US. The ability to predict stroke outcomes within the acute period of stroke would be essential for care planning and rehabilitation. The Blood and Clot Thrombectomy Registry and Collaboration (BACTRAC; clinicaltrials.gov NCT03153683) study collects arterial blood immediately distal and proximal to the intracranial thrombus at the time of mechanical thrombectomy. These blood samples are an innovative resource in evaluating acute gene expression changes at the time of ischemic stroke. The purpose of this study was to identify inflammatory genes and important immune factors during mechanical thrombectomy for emergent large vessel occlusion (ELVO) and which patient demographics were predictors for stroke outcomes (infarct and/or edema volume) in acute ischemic stroke patients. Methods: The BACTRAC study is a non-probability sampling of male and female subjects (&#8805;18 year old) treated with mechanical thrombectomy for ELVO. We evaluated 28 subjects (66 &#177; 15.48 years) relative concentrations of mRNA for gene expression in 84 inflammatory molecules in arterial blood distal and proximal to the intracranial thrombus who underwent thrombectomy. We used the machine learning method, Random Forest to predict which inflammatory genes and patient demographics were important features for infarct and edema volumes. To validate the overlapping genes with outcomes, we perform ordinary least squares regression analysis. Results: Machine learning analyses demonstrated that the genes and subject factors CCR4, IFNA2, IL-9, CXCL3, Age, T2DM, IL-7, CCL4, BMI, IL-5, CCR3, TNF&#945;, and IL-27 predicted infarct volume. The genes and subject factor IFNA2, IL-5, CCL11, IL-17C, CCR4, IL-9, IL-7, CCR3, IL-27, T2DM, and CSF2 predicted edema volume. The overlap of genes CCR4, IFNA2, IL-9, IL-7, IL-5, CCR3, and IL-27 with T2DM predicted both infarct and edema volumes. These genes relate to a microenvironment for chemoattraction and proliferation of autoimmune cells, particularly Th2 cells and neutrophils. Conclusions: Machine learning algorithms can be employed to develop prognostic predictive biomarkers for stroke outcomes in ischemic stroke patients, particularly in regard to identifying acute gene expression changes that occur during stroke.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground: Although wall shear stress (WSS) and pressure play important roles in plaque vulnerability, characteristics of the two indices in intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) have not been fully investigated yet. This study aimed to elucidate this issue by means of establishing a non-invasive computational fluid dynamics method with time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA) of the whole cerebral artery. Materials and Methods: Subjects with symptomatic ICAS in the middle cerebral artery domain were enrolled, excluding those with concomitant internal carotid artery stenosis. Based on patient-specific TOF-MRA images for three-dimensional (3D) meshes and arterial blood pressure with patient-specific carotid artery ultrasonography for inlet boundary conditions, patients' three-dimensional hemodynamics were modeled by a finite element method governed by Navier-Stokes equations. Results: Among the 55 atherosclerotic lesions analyzed by this TOF-MRA based computational fluid dynamics model, the maximum WSS (WSSmax) was most frequently detected at the apex points and the upper half of the upstream sections of the lesions, whereas the maximum pressure was most often located at the lower half of the upstream sections. As the percent stenosis increases, the relative value of WSSmax and pressure drop increased with significantly increasing steep beyond 50% stenosis. Moreover, WSSmax was found to linearly correlate with pressure drop in ICAS. Conclusions: This study on ICAS revealed certain trends of longitudinal distribution of WSS and pressure and the influences of percent stenosis on cerebral hemodynamics, as well as the correlations between WSS and pressure drop. It represents a step forward in applying computational flow simulation techniques in studying ICAS and stroke, in a patient-specific manner.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground: As a result of stroke, patients have problems with locomotion and transfers, which lead to frequent falls. Recovery after stroke is a major goal of rehabilitation, but it is difficult to choose which treatment method is most beneficial for stroke survivors. Recently, powered robotic exoskeletons are used in treatment to maximize the neural recovery of patients after stroke, but there are no studies evaluating the changes in balance among patients rehabilitated with an exoskeleton. Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of Ekso GT exoskeleton-assisted gait training on balance, load distribution, and functional status of patients after ischemic stroke. Methods: The outcomes are based on 44 patients aged 55-85 years after ischemic stroke who were previously randomly assigned into two groups: experimental (with Ekso GT rehabilitation) and control (with classical rehabilitation). At baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment, the patients were evaluated on balance, load distribution, and functional status using, respectively a stabilometric platform, the Barthel Index, and the Rivermead Mobility Index. Results: In the experimental group, balance improved regarding the variables describing sway area as ellipse major and minor axes. In the control group, improvement was noted in sway velocity. After the therapy, total load distribution on feet in both groups showed a small and insignificant tendency toward reduction in the amount of uninvolved limb loading. In the control group, significant load transfer from the backfoot to the forefoot was noted. Both forms of rehabilitation caused significant changes in functional status. Conclusions: Both training with the use of the Ekso GT exoskeleton and classical physiotherapy lead to functional improvement of patients after ischemic stroke. However, in the experimental group, improvement was observed in a larger number of categories, which may suggest potentially greater impact of treatment with the exoskeleton on functional status. Also, both forms of rehabilitation caused significant changes in balance, but we have noted some trends indicating that treatment with exoskeleton may be more beneficial for some patients. The load transfer from the backfoot to the forefoot observed in the control group was an unfavorable phenomenon. We suggest that the Ekso GT exoskeleton may be a promising tool in the rehabilitation of patients after stroke. Trial registration: Trial ID ACTRN12616000148471.",

        "abstract": "\nObjectives: In Romania, the strokes' incidence is of 61,500 per year and improving upper limb function is the essence in rehabilitation after a stroke to maximize the patient quality of life and reduce disability. In this study, it is compared the cost-effectiveness of the treatment of post-stroke upper limb spasticity with incobotulinumtoxin-A (INCO), with or without electromyographic control, against the conventional therapy programme alone (CON). Methods: A Markov state transition model was developed to effectuate a cost-utility analysis (CUA). Measurements of health-related quality of life were derived from relevant clinical trials. Utility values for quality of life by response status were derived from the Short-Form-12 (SF-12) Health Survey data from a published study. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of INCO (fixed, every 12 weeks) against CON was calculated in Ron per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for both therapies. Costs and outcomes were discounted using different scenarios at 3% and 5% per year with a time horizon of 3 and 5 years because Romanian legislative norms don't specify the discount rates and time horizon for pharmacoeconomic analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were managed on the base case with distributions attributed to the frequency of repeat dosing and utility valuation of the responder and the non-responder for health utilities derived from both mental and physical health state. Results: Compared with CON, in all 4 scenarios, therapy with INCO had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of less than 950 Euro per QALY gained (1 Euro = 4.7 Ron). INCO proved to be more favorable treatment option than CON in the treatment of upper limb spasticity in Romania. Despite costs being higher for patients treated with INCO, this treatment has more advantageous Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio. Conclusions: This therapy should be taken into account when considering rehabilitation options because it is highly cost-effective at < EURO 1,000/QALY gained, a very low WTP (Willingness To Pay) threshold. INCO proved to be a disruptive innovation because it is a new and more effective treatment, and, in the end, much higher in quality of life for patients with post-stroke upper limb spasticity.",

We attempted to investigate the association between newly developed POP and hypoalbuminaemia and to identify whether hypoalbuminaemia is an independent risk factor for POP after femoral neck fracture in geriatric population.\nWe retrospectively reviewed the records from the first 30 days after surgery of patients who were &#8805;65 years of age and who had a femoral neck fracture treated with surgery between January 2018 and December 2018 at the Honghui Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University. Patients were divided into two groups based on whether they did or did not experience POP, and their clinical characteristics were compared. Binomial logistic regression was used to identify potential risk factors of POP by analysing demographic factors, preoperative comorbidities, laboratory results, and surgical factors.\nA total of 720 patients were included in the analysis, and 54 patients experienced POP. The incidence of POP after surgical treatment for a femoral neck fracture in this geriatric population was 7.5%. In addition, patients with POP had significantly longer hospital stays than patients without POP. The binary logistic regression analysis revealed that preoperative hypoalbuminaemia [odds ratio =5.187, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.561-10.506, P<0.0001], COPD (OR =3.819, 95% CI: 1.247-11.701, P=0.019), prior stroke (OR =3.107, 95% CI: 1.470-6.568, P=0.003) and the time from injury to surgery (OR =1.076, 95% CI: 1.034-1.119, P<0.0001) were predominant and independent risk factors associated with POP after femoral neck fracture in this geriatric population.\nThe current study revealed that among a geriatric population admitted for femoral neck fracture surgery, preoperative hypoalbuminaemia was a predictor of POP, followed by COPD, prior stroke and the time from injury to surgery.

High respiratory ArTH was independently associated with WUS (OR 5.556, 95% CI 1.959-15.761, p&#160;=&#160;0.001).\nThe correlation between SBD and WUS suggests that sleep apnea might induce acute physiological changes that trigger the onset of stroke. We show that reduced respiratory arousability is associated with WUS, and hypothesize that reduced cortical capability to generate respiratory arousal may have a role in triggering stroke during sleep.",

        "title": "A Pictorial Review of Intracranial Haemorrhage Revisited.",
        "abstract": "\nThe many causes of Intracerebral Haemorrhage (IH) can be difficult to differentiate. However, there are imaging features that can provide useful clues. This paper aims to provide a pictorial review of the common causes of IH, to identify some distinguishing diagnostic features and to provide guidance on subsequent imaging and follow up. It is hoped that this review would benefit radiology and non-radiology consultants, multi-professional workers and trainees who are commonly exposed to unenhanced CT head studies but are not neuroradiology specialists.\nIn the absence of trauma, Spontaneous Intracerebral Haemorrhage (SIH) can be classified as idiopathic or secondary. Secondary causes of IH include hypertension and amyloid angiopathy (75-80%) and less common pathologies such as vascular malformations (arteriovenous malformations, aneurysms and cavernomas), malignancy , venous sinus thrombosis and infection. SIH causes between 10 to 15% of all strokes and has a higher mortality than ischaemic stroke. Trauma is another cause of IH with significant mortality and some of the radiological features will be reviewed.\nUnenhanced CT is a mainstay of acute phase imaging due to its availability and, sensitivity and specificity for detecting acute haemorrhage. Several imaging features can be identified on CT and, along with clinical information, can provide some certainty in diagnosis. For those suitable and where diagnostic uncertainty remains CT angiogram, time-resolved CT angiography and catheter angiography can help identify underlying AVMs, aneurysms, cavernomas and vasculitides. MRI is more sensitive for the detection of subacute and chronic haemorrhage and identification of underlying mass lesions.",

        "abstract": "\nEchocardiography and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMRI) are two noninvasive techniques for the evaluation of cardiac function for patients with coronary artery diseases. Although echocardiography is the commonly used technique in clinical practice for the assessment of cardiac function, the measurement of LV volumes and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by the use of this technique is still influenced by several factors inherent to the protocol acquisition, which may affect the accuracy of echocardiography in the measurement of global LV parameters.\nThe aim of this study is to compare the end systolic volume (ESV), the end diastolic volume (EDV), and the LVEF values obtained with three dimensional echocardiography (3D echo) with those obtained by CMRI (3 Tesla) in order to estimate the accuracy of 3D echo in the assessment of cardiac function.\n20 subjects, (9 controls, 6 with myocardial infarction, and 5 with myocarditis) with age varying from 18 to 58, underwent 3D echo and CMRI. LV volumes and LVEF were computed from CMRI using a stack of cine MRI images in a short axis view. The same parameters were calculated using the 3D echo. A linear regression analysis and Bland Altman diagrams were performed to evaluate the correlation and the degree of agreement between the measurements obtained by the two methods.\nThe obtained results show a strong correlation between the 3D echo and CMR in the measurement of functional parameters (r = 0.96 for LVEF values, r = 0.99 for ESV and r= 0.98 for EDV, p < 0.01 for all) with a little lower values of LV volumes and higher values of LVEF by 3D echo compared to CMRI. According to statistical analysis, there is a slight discrepancy between the measurements obtained by the two methods.\n3D echo represents an accurate noninvasive tool for the assessment of cardiac function. However, other studies should be conducted on a larger population including some complicated diagnostic cases.",

        "title": "Preoperative Depression and Plasma Cortisol Levels as Predictors of Delirium after Cardiac Surgery.",
        "abstract": "\nDelirium is common in old patients who undergo cardiac surgery, and it is associated with adverse outcomes. The genesis of delirium is thought to be multi-factorial, but it is still not well understood. Symptoms of depression and elevated cortisol level have been described in some previous studies as factors associated with delirium, suggesting a shared pathophysiology.\nThe objective of the present study was to determine whether preoperative depression symptoms and increased cortisol level represent risk factors for delirium after cardiac surgery.\nWe performed a prospective cohort study in 183 patients aged >50 years undergoing elective cardiac surgery. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) was used to assess patients for depressive symptoms before surgery. Preoperative plasma cortisol levels were available in 145 participants. Delirium was diagnosed using the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) during the first 7 days after surgery. Spearman correlation was used for correlations between GDS, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Charlson comorbidity index, and age. Binary logistic regression was used to determine whether GDS and cortisol levels predict postoperative delirium.\nDelirium occurred in 60 patients out of 183 (32.8%) included and lasted 2.3 days (SD 1.36). GDS was correlated with age (p = 0.001) and comorbidity index (p = 0.003) and inversely correlated with MMSE score (p < 0.001). Higher preoperative GDS scores were associated with incidence of delirium in the postoperative period (p = 0.002). The association was significant after controlling for age, MMSE score, history of stroke, and Charlson comorbidity index (p = 0.045). Preoperative cortisol level was not associated with the development of postoperative delirium.\nOur results suggest that a higher preoperative depression score is associated with an increased risk of postoperative delirium. On the other hand, preoperative plasma cortisol level does not seem to be a predictor of delirium after surgery. Further studies are needed to determine the potential of preoperative depression treatment to prevent postoperative delirium.",

We investigated how clinical factors and the level of atrial fibrillation (AF) knowledge affect the bleeding acceptance in patients with AF.\nIn 173 consecutive anticoagulated outpatients with AF (aged 68.7 &#177; 10.7 years, 39.3% male), the bleeding ratio was assessed based on the declared maximum number of major bleeds the people were willing to endure to avert 1 stroke. The Jessa AF Knowledge Questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge of AF.\nCompared with patients with the high bleeding ratio (&#8805;&#160;4&#160;accepted bleedings, n&#160;= 88, 50.9%), subjects with the low bleeding ratio (0-3 accepted bleedings, n&#160;= 85, 49.1%) were older, with longer duration of AF, suffered more commonly from heart failure, and were free of cerebrovascular events. Patients after major bleeding (n&#160;= 33, 19.1%) and those reporting minor bleeds on anticoagulation (n&#160;= 77, 44.5%) had lower bleeding ratio. The independent predictors of the low bleeding ratio were older age (odds ratio [OR], 2.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69-3.70), major bleeds on anticoagulation (OR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.16-10.0), minor bleeds on anticoagulation (OR, 3.45; 95% CI, 1.67-7.14), and prior stroke/transient ischemic attack (OR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.22-0.99). The level of knowledge of AF did not affect the bleeding ratio.\nThe key determinants of the bleeding ratio among anticoagulated patients with AF are age, and prior thromboembolic and bleeding episodes. The study could support identification of patients with AF who need additional effort to increase their acceptance of a life-long oral anticoagulation therapy.",

This study aimed to investigate the safety and effectiveness of percutaneous aortic valve intervention (PAVI) in patients with AS before non-CS.\nWe analyzed pooled data within a multicenter Japanese registry from 118 patients with severe AS who underwent PAVI before non-CS. Sixty patients underwent percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) and 58 patients underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The groups' baseline characteristics, perioperative complications, and 30-day mortality and midterm mortality after non-CS were compared.\nThe postprocedural mean pressure gradient was higher in the BAV group than in the TAVR group (35.0&#8239;&#177;&#8239;11.5&#8239;mmHg vs. 11.5&#8239;&#177;&#8239;4.8&#8239;mmHg, p&#8239;<&#8239;0.001).

        "abstract": "\nA concurrent carotid and cardiac disease is the paradigmatic expression of a multidistrictal vasculopathy related to an atherosclerotic burden, that shares the same risk factors and onset pathophysiological mechanisms. The absolute incidence of a stroke after open heart surgery (OHS) is about 2%, higher in case of combined cardiac procedures, with a negative prognostic impact in terms of in-hospital mortality and neurological morbidity. Heterogenous and interlinked risk factors contribute to the genesis of cerebral injuries after OHS outlining patient general features, vascular risk parameters and severity indeces of cardiac disease; a model stroke for patients undergoing cardiac surgery may be helpful so as to identify subsets of patients at high risk and select the most appropriate strategy. A critical carotid stenosis should be contextualized not as the Romadirect cause of stroke, but as a risk marker of high grade atherosclerotic systemic disease, predicting a potential severe aortic or intracerebral vessel disease and leading to recognize and study carefully these multivascular patients before operation. The idea of carotid plaque as active embolic source is valid only in case of vulnerable plaques in relation to the potential detachment of particulate material. Until now the neurological status, in accordance with symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis, has markedly influenced the operation timing and the choice of the surgical strategy. Except for special circumstances, we generally suggest a 'reverse staged' surgical strategy with cardiac surgery before carotid timing in elective patients recommending strongly a pharmacological neuroprotection relied on the administration of Sodium Thiopentone. Most of carotid stenosis in patients undergoing OHS is asymptomatic and doesn't represent a proven independent risk factor for postoperative stroke; indeed, we advocate that synchronous surgical treatment of both carotid and cardiac lesions is burdened from higher perioperative mortality and stroke rates rightfully unjustifiable according to potential benefits.",

We have conducted a longitudinal study between November&#160;2015 and September&#160;2017 at the Brazzaville University Hospital. Children with sickle cell disease requiring treatment with hydroxyurea were included. The variables studied were therapeutic compliance, evolutive profile of nutritional status, indications of hydroxyurea, electrophoresis of hemoglobin, blood count, and toxicity. The statistical test used was Student test with a significance threshold of less than 0.05. One thousand twenty-four children were monitored for sickle cell disease, 107&#160;of which had received hydroxyurea (10.4%). The indications for hydroxyurea were recurrent anemic attacks (&#8805; 4) in 62&#160;cases (57.9%), neurological crises 19&#160;cases (17.8%), recurrent hyperalgesic crises in 17&#160;cases (15.9%), priapism in 4&#160;cases (3.7), and acute thoracic syndrome in 2&#160;cases (1.9%). Therapeutic compliance was good in 89.5% of them. A rapid and lasting clinical improvement was noted in the majority of patients with hyperalgesic attacks (88.2%) and anemic attacks (88.7%), two recurrences for the cerebrovascular accidents, and an absence of recurrence of priapism and of the acute thoracic syndrome. From the biological point of view, there was a significant increase in fetal hemoglobin (1.2 to 16.2%; P &#8197;<&#8197;0.05), hemoglobin (7 to 8.3&#160;g/dl; P&#8197;<&#8197;0.05), mean cell volume (80.8 to 96&#160;fl; P &#8197;<&#8197;0.05) and a significant decrease in mean white blood cell count (15,633 to 9,872/mm3; P &#8197;<&#8197;0.05) and platelets (387,002 to 324,400/mm3; P &#8197;<&#8197;0.05). The signs of toxicity observed were mainly vomiting and thrombocytopenia in two cases each, one case with headache and the other with neutropenia. Indications for use of hydroxyurea therapy in children with sickle cell disease in Brazzaville are common. These are dominated by recurrent anemic seizures, strokes, and hyperalgesic seizures. The excellent evolution of these complications under hydroxyurea represents an interesting alternative in our countries with limited resources.",

Acute ischemic stroke can be caused by several factors, but the main ones are arterial and cardiac embolism, arterial wall disease or variants(1-4). The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, is widely used as clinical assessment for neurological deficits related to ischemic stroke(1). MDCTA and Magnetic Resonance Imaging are the two gold standard methods for diagnosis in acute ischemic stroke patients(1-5). Thrombolytic therapy of this pathological state began in the fifties, while the endovascular mechanical thrombectomy was defined as a new standard of care in 2015(1,5,6). This recent technique have added tissue window\" to the existing \"time window\" (5,6). So, nowadays patients with small ischemic core, large penumbra, and good collaterals vessel may benefit from endovascular mechanical thrombectomy(1,5,6); even if they arrive within 6-24 h of stroke onset(5.",

        "abstract": "\nPurpose: Malnutrition is extensively prevalent amongst critically ill patients afflicted by ischemic stroke (IS). This study purpose was to evaluate the protein whey effect on inflammatory and antioxidant markers and functional prognosis in acute IS patients. Methods: out of 42 patients with acute IS who were referred to Imam Reza Educational Hospital, Tabriz, Iran, 40 patients participated in the study. Twenty-one patients as control group received the hospital routine formula, and 19 patients as intervention group received 20 g/daily of whey protein through oral gavage. Inflammation and oxidative stress indicators (e.g., albumin, malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#945;), and high sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP)and clinical variables included in were evaluated using National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) during admission and also 3 weeks after intervention. Results: Whey protein supplementation significantly decreased the NIHSS and mRS scores, TNF-&#945;, IL-6, and hs-CRP by passing 3 weeks from intervention (P<0.05). However, whey formula had no significant effect on other markers including albumin, and MDA. The hs-CRP (P = 0.02) reduction was significantly higher in whey protein group in comparison with control group. Conclusion: Whey protein supplementation reduced inflammation markers in those patients with IS. However, these changes should be studied in larger-scale trials.",

        "abstract": "\nThe diagnostic yield of 24-hour ECG Holter monitoring (24H) is currently overcome by alternative ECG monitoring techniquesand it needs to be optimized. The recognition of inter-atrial block (IAB) has emerged as a reliable indicator of patients at risk of atrial fibrillation relapses, and its role enhancing the yield of 24H is yet to be determined. We hypothesized that a presumably low yield of 24H may be ameliorated by means of incorporating the assessment for IAB.\nWe retrospectively analyzed 1017 consecutive 24H registers performed in a Multidisciplinary Integrated Health Care Institution, in which a restrictive definition of diagnostic 24H findings was used. A univariate and multivariate regression analysis served to determine the variables associated with a higher 24H's yield, including the requesting medical specialty, type of indication and a number of clinical, echocardiographic and ECG variables, including IAB.\nThe mean age of our population was 62 &#177; 17 years (55% males). The majority of 24H were indicated from the Cardiology department (48%). The overall yield was 12.8%, higher for the assessment of the integrity of the electrical conduction system (26.1%) and poorer for the assessment of syncope (3.2%) and cryptogenic stroke (4.6%). The variables associated with higher diagnostic performance were indication from Cardiology (p < 0.001), IAB (p = 0.004), structural heart disease (p = 0.008) and chronic renal failure (p = 0.009). Patients &#8804; 50 years old only retrieved a 7% yield. In the multivariate analysis, indication from Cardiology and IAB remained significant predictors of higher 24H's yield. In a secondary analysis including echocardiographic data, only identification of IAB remained statistically significant.\nThe recognition of IAB and the type of indication are major determinants of a higher 24H's diagnostic yield and may help to optimize the selection of candidates.",

        "abstract": "\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is a leading source of emboli that precipitate cerebrovascular accident (CVA) which is correlated with left atrial appendage (LAA) morphology. We aimed to elaborate the relationship between CVA and LAA morphology in AF patients.\nMedline and EMBASE databases were thoroughly searched between 2010-2018 for studies that included atrial fibrillation patients and classified them into two groups based on CVA occurrence. Four different LAA morphologies (Chicken wing CW, Cauliflower, cactus and windsock) were determined in each group by 3D TEE, MDCT or CMRI. New Castle Ottawa Scale was used to appraise the quality of included studies. The risk of CVA before cardiac ablation and/or LAA intervention in CW patients was compared to each type of non-CW morphologies. The extracted data was statistically analyzed in the form of forest plot by measuring the risk ratio (RR) using REVMAN software. P value and I square were used to assess the heterogeneity between studies.\nPRISMA diagram was illustrated showing 789 imported studies for screening. Three duplicates were removed, and the rest were arbitrated by 2 reviewers yielding 12 included studies with 3486 patients including 1551 with CW, 442 with cauliflower, 732 with cactus 765 with windsock. The risk of CVA in CW patients was reduced by 41% relative to non-CW patients (Total RR=0.59 (0.52-0.68)). Likewise, the risk of CVA in CW patients was less by 46%, 35% and 31% compared to cauliflower (Total RR =0.54(0.46-0.64)), cactus (Total RR =0.65(0.55-0.77)) and windsock (Total RR =0.69(0.58-0.83)) patients respectively. Low levels of heterogeneity were achieved in all comparisons (I square <35% and p value > 0.1).\nPatients with non-CW morphologies (cauliflower, cactus and windsock) show a higher incidence of CVA than CW patients. For that reason, LAA appendage morphology could be useful for risk stratification of CVA in AF patients.",

        "abstract": "\nUnder physiological states, the nervous system and the kidneys communicate with each other to maintain normal body homeostasis. However, pathological states disrupt this interaction as seen in hypertension, and kidney damage can cause impaired renorenal reflex and sodium handling. In acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), damaged kidneys can have a detrimental effect on the central nervous system. CKD is an independent risk factor for cerebrovascular disease and cognitive impairment, and many factors, including retention of uremic toxins and phosphate, have been proposed as CKD-specific factors responsible for structural and functional cerebral changes in patients with CKD. However, more studies are needed to determine the precise pathogenesis. Epidemiological studies have shown that AKI is associated with a subsequent risk for developing stroke and dementia. However, recent animal studies have shown that the renal nerve contributes to kidney inflammation and fibrosis, whereas activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, which involves the vagus nerve, the splenic nerve, and immune cells in the spleen, has a significant renoprotective effect. Therefore, elucidating mechanisms of communication between the nervous system and the kidney enables us not only to develop new strategies to ameliorate neurological conditions associated with kidney disease but also to design safe and effective clinical interventions for kidney disease, using the neural and neuroimmune control of kidney injury and disease.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground Shengui Sansheng Pulvis (SSP) has about 300 years history used for stroke treatment, and evidences suggest it has beneficial effects on neuro-angiogenesis and cerebral energy metabolic amelioration post-stroke. However, its protective action and mechanisms on blood-brain barrier (BBB) is still unknown. Purpose Based on multiple neuroprotective properties of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) in neurological disorders, we investigate if SSP maintaining BBB integrity is associated with VIP pathway in rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model. Methods Three doses of SSP extraction were administered orally. Evaluations of motor and balance abilities and detection of brain edema were performed, and BBB permeability were assessed by Evans blue (EB) staining. Primary brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation, and incubated with high dose SSP drug-containing serum and VIP-antagonist respectively. Transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) assay and Tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)-dextran (4.4&#8201;kDa) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran (70&#8201;kDa) were used to evaluate the features of paracellular junction. Western blot detected the expressions of Claudin-5, ZO-1, Occludin and VE-cadherin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2/9 and VIP receptors 1/2, and immunofluorescence staining tested VIP and Claudin-5 expressions. Results Our results show that SSP significantly reduces EB infiltration in dose-dependent manner in vivo and attenuates TRITC- dextran and FITC-dextran diffusion in vitro, and strengthens endothelial junctional complexes as represented by decreasing Claudin-5, ZO-1, Occludin and VE-cadherin degradations and MMP 2/9 expression, as well as promoting TEER in BMECs after ischemia. Moreover, it suggests that SSP notably enhances VIP and its receptors 1/2 expressions. VIP-antagonist exacerbates paracellular barrier of BMECs, while the result is reversed after incubation with high dose SSP drug-containing serum. Additionally, SSP also improve brain edema and motor and balance abilities after ischemic stroke. Conclusions we firstly demonstrate that the ameliorated efficacy of SSP on BBB permeability is related to the enhancements of VIP and its receptors, suggesting SSP might be an effective therapeutic agent on maintaining BBB integrity post-stroke.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether the antiaggregatory effect of acetylsalicylic acid correlates with platelet-derived microvesicles in convalescent ischaemic stroke patients and cardiovascular risk factor controls as well as to evaluate the association between high on-treatment platelet reactivity and recurrent vascular events with the studied platelet-derived microvesicle parameters.\nThe study groups consisted of 76 convalescent stroke patients and 74 controls. Total platelet-derived microvesicles, annexino-positive microvesicles number, and platelet-derived microvesicles with surface expression of proinflammatory (CD40L, CD62P, CD31) and procoagulant (PS, GPIIb/IIIa) markers were characterized and quantified using flow cytometry. Cyclooxygenase-1-specific platelet responsiveness, with whole blood impedance platelet aggregation under arachidonic acid stimulation and the serum concentration of thromboxane B2, were evaluated.\nNeither acetylsalicylic acid intake nor modification of its daily dose caused statistically significant differences in the studied microvesicle parameters. Additionally, no statistically significant differences in the studied microvesicle parameters were revealed between high on-treatment platelet reactivity and non-high on-treatment platelet reactivity subjects in either study subgroup. However, elevated concentrations of PAC-1+/CD61+, CD62P+/CD61+ and CD31+/CD61+ microvesicles were found in stroke patients with treatment failure, defined in this study as a recurrent vascular events in a one-year follow-up period.\nThis study revealed no relationship between circulating microvesicle number and platelet aggregation.

        "abstract": "\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCA) is routinely used in the clinic to visualize lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS). Although GBCA reveal endothelial permeability, they fail to expose other aspects of lesion formation such as the magnitude of inflammation or tissue changes occurring at sites of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Moreover, evidence pointing to potential side effects of GBCA has been increasing. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop GBCA-independent imaging tools to monitor pathology in MS. Using MR-elastography (MRE), we previously demonstrated in both MS and the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) that inflammation was associated with a reduction of brain stiffness. Now, using the relapsing-remitting EAE model, we show that the cerebellum-a region with predominant inflammation in this model-is especially prone to loss of stiffness. We also demonstrate that, contrary to GBCA-MRI, reduction of brain stiffness correlates with clinical disability and is associated with enhanced expression of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (FN). Further, we show that FN is largely expressed by activated astrocytes at acute lesions, and reflects the magnitude of tissue remodeling at sites of BBB breakdown. Therefore, MRE could emerge as a safe tool suitable to monitor disease activity in MS.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground: Carotid artery stenosis (CAS), typically resulting from atherosclerotic progression, is more common than intracranial atherosclerotic disease in patients with cerebrovascular disease. Prior literature has incompletely established the relationship of Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and CAS complexity and severity. This study aims to more thoroughly evaluate the association of plasma PTX3 levels and the prevalence and severity of CAS in patients with cerebrovascular disease. Methods: Two hundred and six patients with ischemic stroke underwent multiphase computerized tomography angiography (CTA) of the head and neck to assess the presence and severity of carotid artery stenosis. Patients were divided into groups with either no carotid artery stenosis (CAS-free) or carotid artery stenosis (CAS). The CAS group was further divided into groups based on the degree of stenosis and the number of involved vessels. The PTX3 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;) concentration were measured by ELISA. Results: Plasma levels of PTX3, TNF-&#945;, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were increased significantly in the CAS group patients vs. the CAS-free group (p = 0.000, 0.002, 0.002, respectively). Within the CAS group, PTX3, TNF-&#945;, and LDL-C were significantly elevated in stenosis of &#8805;50% group compared to <50% group (p = 0.001, 0.002, 0.049, respectively). The multivariate logistic binary regression analysis revealed that increased age, elevated levels of PTX3, LDL-C, and TNF-&#945; were all independent risk factors for occurrence of carotid stenosis. PTX3 level correlated with the severity of carotid stenosis. Conclusions: High plasma PTX3 levels, TNF-&#945;, and LDL-C are significantly correlated with the prevalence and severity of carotid artery stenosis. PTX3 may be a more powerful predictor for the severity of carotid artery stenosis.",

        "abstract": "\nThere is growing evidence that after a stroke, sensorimotor deficits in the ipsilesional hand are related to the degree of impairment in the contralesional upper extremity. Here, we asked if the relationship between the motor capacities of the two hands differs based on the side of stroke. Forty-two pre-morbidly right-handed chronic stroke survivors (left hemisphere damage, LHD = 21) with mild-to-moderate paresis performed distal items of the Wolf Motor Function Test (dWMFT). We found that compared to RHD, the relationship between contralesional arm impairment (Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer, UEFM) and ipsilesional hand motor capacity was stronger (  R L H D 2  = 0.42;  R R H D 2   < 0.01; z = 2.12; p = 0.03) and the slope was steeper (t = -2.03; p = 0.04) in LHD. Similarly, the relationship between contralesional dWMFT and ipsilesional hand motor capacity was stronger (  R L H D 2  = 0.65;  R R H D 2   = 0.09; z = 2.45; p = 0.01) and the slope was steeper (t = 2.03; p = 0.04) in LHD compared to RHD. Multiple regression analysis confirmed the presence of an interaction between contralesional UEFM and side of stroke (&#946;3 = 0.66 &#177; 0.30; p = 0.024) and between contralesional dWMFT and side of stroke (&#946;3 = -0.51 &#177; 0.34; p = 0.05). Our findings suggest that the relationship between contra- and ipsi-lesional motor capacity depends on the side of stroke in chronic stroke survivors with mild-to-moderate impairment. When contralesional impairment is more severe, the ipsilesional hand is proportionally slower in those with LHD compared to those with RHD.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground and Purpose: Inflammation plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The role of &#946;2-microglobulin (&#946;2M) as a potential initiator of the inflammatory response in AIS is unclear. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship of serum &#946;2M with the recurrence risk and 3-month outcome of AIS. Methods: A total of 205 patients with AIS were recruited, and their clinical and biochemical characteristics were collected. All patients were followed up for 3 months after stroke onset, and the occurrence of death or major disability at 3 months after onset was the outcome of interest in this study. We evaluated the association of serum &#946;2M levels with the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, and Essen Stroke Risk Score (ESRS) values in patients with AIS. Then, we used receiver operating curve analysis to calculate the optimal cutoff value for discriminating outcomes in patients with AIS and a binary logistic regression model to evaluate the risk factors for a poor outcome after AIS. Results: Our results showed that serum &#946;2M levels were significantly and positively correlated with ESRS values (r = 0.176, P < 0.001) and mRS scores (r = 0.402, P < 0.001), but the levels of &#946;2M were not correlated with NIHSS scores (r = 0.080, P = 0.255) or with infarct volume (r = 0.013, P = 0.859). In a further study, we found that 121 patients (59.02%) had poor outcomes. The optimal &#946;2M cutoff to predict the 3-month outcome of AIS in this study was 1.865 mg/l, and &#946;2M was independently associated with a poor outcome at 3 months (OR = 3.325, 95% confidence interval: 1.089~10.148). Conclusions: In conclusion, we inferred that serum &#946;2M was positively associated with the recurrence risk and 3-month outcome of AIS, but it did not appear to be directly related to the severity of AIS or the size of the infarct at admission.",

        "abstract": "\nCardiovascular risk is elevated in divers, but detailed information of cardiac function during diving is missing. The aim of this study was to apply an intact rat model with continuous monitoring of cardiac left ventricular (LV) function in a simulated diving experiment. Thirteen rats were inserted with a LV pressure-volume catheter and a pressure transducer in the femoral artery to measure hemodynamic variables, and randomly assigned to diving (n = 9) and control (n = 4) groups. The diving group was compressed to 600 kPa in air, maintained at pressure for 45 min (bottom phase), and decompressed to surface at 50 kPa/min. Data was collected before, during, and up to 60 min after exposure in the diving group, and at similar times in non-diving controls. During the bottom phase, stroke volume (SV) (-29%) and cardiac output (-30%) decreased, whereas LV end-systolic volume (+13%), mean arterial pressure (MAP) (+29%), and total peripheral resistance (TPR) (+72%) increased. There were no changes in LV contractility, stroke work, or diastolic function. All hemodynamic variables returned to baseline values within 60 min after diving. In conclusion, our simulated dive experiment to 600 kPa increased MAP and TPR to levels which caused a substantial reduction in SV and LV volume output. The increase in cardiac afterload demonstrated to take place during a dive is well tolerated by the healthy heart in our model, whereas in a failing heart this abrupt change in afterload may lead to acute cardiac decompensation.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground and Objective: Qing-Kai-Ling (QKL) is derived from a famous ancient Chinese patent medicine Angong Niuhuang pills (ANP) which has been used across Asia, especially in China, for the treatment of \"febrile disease,\" such as stroke, encephalitis and meningitis for hundreds of years. As an extract of ANP without heavy metal, the clinical applicability of QKL is more intensive, of which its injection is commonly used in acute and serious diseases. This study aims to clarify the potential mechanisms of immediate hypersensitivity reaction (IHR) induced by QKL injection (QKLI). Methods: &#946;-hexosaminidase release assay was performed on the human mast cell line LAD2 and mouse peritoneal mast cells. T helper 2 (Th2) immunity-amplified mice were prepared by aluminum adjuvant. Anaphylactic shock was detected by measuring rectal thermometry in propranolol-pretreated mice. For evaluating microvascular permeability, Evans Blue extravasation assay was used. Serum total IgE (tIgE) and the activated complement-derived anaphylatoxin C3 (C3a) levels were measured by ELISA. Results: QKLI was unable to elevate serum tIgE level in the Th2 immunity-amplified mice, but can increase vasopermeability and trigger anaphylaxis after the first injection. By screening seven fractions of QKLI, only the extract of Isatidis Radix (Isatis tinctoria L.) induced hindpaw Evans Blue extravasation, which was disappeared in Isatidis Radix-free QKLI. Mechanism study indicated that QKLI or Isatidis Radix-caused IHR could be blocked by the antagonists for histamine or C3a, rather than PAF or C5a. Consistently, QKLI and Isatidis Radix could also directly activate human serum complement-derived anaphylatoxin 3 (C3) in vitro with the half effective concentration values of 0.69% and 218.6 &#956;g/ml, respectively. Conclusion: QKLI-IHR is complement activation-related pseudoallergy, rather than an IgE-mediated allergy. QKLI activates C3 and might consequently provoke mast cells to release histamine, which is a principal effector of its IHR. The pseudoallergic reaction induced by QKLI was attributed to the extract of Isatidis Radix. This study suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for the prophylaxis and treatment of QKLI-IHR.",

        "abstract": "\nMicroparticles (MPs, ~size between 0.1 and 1 mm) are lipid encased containers derived from intact cells which contain antigen from the parent cells. MPs are involved in intercellular communication and regulate inflammation. Stroke increases secretion of brain derived MP (BDMP) which activate macrophages/microglia and induce neuroinflammation. Lactadherin (Milk fat globule-EGF factor-8) binds to anionic phospholipids and extracellular matrices, promotes apoptotic cell clearance and limits pathogenic antigen cross presentation. In this study, we investigate whether BDMP affects stroke-induced neuroinflammation and whether Lactadherin treatment reduces stroke initiated BDMP-induced neuroinflammation, thereby improving functional outcome after stroke. Middle aged (8-9 months old) male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAo) stroke, and BDMPs were extracted from ischemic brain 24 h after dMCAo by ultracentrifugation. Adult male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to dMCAo and treated via tail vein injection at 3 h after stroke with: (A) +PBS (n = 5/group); (B) +BDMPs (1.5 &#215; 108, n = 6/group); (C) +Lactadherin (400 &#956;g/kg, n = 5/group); (D) +BDMP+Lactadherin (n = 6/group). A battery of neurological function tests were performed and mice sacrificed for immunostaining at 14 days after stroke. Blood plasma was used for Western blot assay. Our data indicate: (1) treatment of Stroke with BDMP significantly increases lesion volume, neurological deficits, blood brain barrier (BBB) leakage, microglial activation, inflammatory cell infiltration (CD45, microglia/macrophages, and neutrophils) into brain, inflammatory factor (TNF&#945;, IL6, and IL1&#946;) expression in brain, increases axon/white matter (WM) damage identified by decreased axon and myelin density, and increases inflammatory factor expression in the plasma when compared to PBS treated stroke mice; (2) when compared to PBS and BDMP treated stroke mice, Lactadherin and BDMP+Lactadherin treatment significantly improves neurological outcome, and decreases lesion volume, BBB leakage, axon/WM injury, inflammatory cell infiltration and inflammatory factor expression in the ischemic brain, respectively. Lactadherin treatment significantly increases anti-inflammatory factor (IL10) expression in ischemic brain and decreases IL1&#946; expression in plasma compared to PBS and BDMP treated stroke mice, respectively. BDMP increases neuroinflammation and aggravates ischemic brain damage after stroke. Thus, Lactadherin exerts anti-inflammatory effects and improves the clearance of MPs to reduce stroke and BDMP induced neurological deficits.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground: Prognostic models can estimate the recovery of arm functioning after stroke, guide the selection of individual training strategies, and inform patient selection in clinical trials. Several models for early prediction of arm recovery have been proposed, but their implementation has been hindered by insufficient external validation, limited evidence of their impact on patient outcomes, and reliance on predictors that are not feasible in regular clinical practice. Objectives: To determine the predictive value of new and previously reported tests that can be easily conducted in regular clinical settings for early prognosis of two levels of favorable arm recovery at 6 months post-stroke. Methods: We performed a secondary analysis of merged data (n = 223) from two Scandinavian prospective longitudinal cohorts. The candidate predictors were seven individual tests of motor function and the sensory function measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity within 7 days post-stroke, and the whole motor section of this assessment. For each candidate predictor, we calculated the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of two levels of residual motor impairment in the affected arm at 6 months post-stroke: moderate-to-mild (&#8805;32 points on the motor section of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity, FMA-UE) and mild (FMA-UE &#8805; 58 points). Results: Patients with partial shoulder abduction (OR 14.6), elbow extension (OR 15.9), and finger extension (OR 9.5) were more likely to reach FMA-UE &#8805; 32. Patients with full function on all individual motor tests (OR 5.5-35.3) or partial elbow extension, pronation/supination, wrist dorsiflexion and grasping ability (OR 2.1-18.3) were more likely to achieve FMA-UE &#8805; 58 compared with those with absent function. Intact sensory function (OR 2.0-2.2) and moderate motor impairment on the FMA-UE (OR 7.5) were also associated with favorable outcome. Conclusions: Easily conducted motor tests can be useful for early prediction of arm recovery. The added value of this study is the prediction of two levels of a favorable functional outcome from simple motor tests. This knowledge can be used in the development of prognostic models feasible in regular clinical settings, inform patient selection and stratification in future trials, and guide clinicians in the selection of individualized training strategies for improving arm functioning after stroke.

Turk J Pediatr 2019; 61: 629-634. Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-associated vasculopathy is usually diagnosed decades after the clinical diagnosis of NF1. Childhood NF1-associated renal artery vasculopathy or moyamoya-like brain vasculopathy could be clinically silent for a long time. We report a 12-year-old boy who had systemic hypertension found incidentally at a routine check-up. Physical examination showed caf&#233;au- lait spots and strong radial pulses. Abdominal computerized tomography angiography showed severe right ostial renal artery stenosis. Genomic study showed a heterozygous mutation c.5902C > T (p.R1968*) and two heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphisms (NCBI: SNP rs18011052 and rs2905876) of NF1 gene. After endovascular revascularization for renovascular hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis, including percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty and stent implantation, blood pressure dropped effectively from 205/143 mmHg to 130/90 mmHg. Supine renin level dropped from 87.2 pg/ mL to 47.9 pg/mL. Unfortunately, right hemiplegia, transient visual loss with blind spots (scotomas), and clumsiness of extremities emerged insidiously 3.5 months later. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography showed ischemic infarction involving the watershed area of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, indicating presence of moyamoya-like brain vasculopathy. A dilemma is that a significant decrease of blood pressure after endovascular revascularization for renal artery stenosis may have potentially unmask the moyamoya-like brain vasculopathy in this patient. Vasculopathy could be heralding childhood NF1 in the young patients without full-fledged clinical features. Endovascular revascularization for renal artery stenosis could be a double-edge sword in childhood NF1 presenting with concomitant renal and cerebral artery vasculopathy.",

Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (tachycardiomyopathy) is defined by the presence of a sustained tachycardia that results in left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Restoration of cardiac function is dependent on the control of tachyarrhythmias. We report a series including ten children with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy with different etiologies. The medical records of patients with tachycardiomyopathy who were managed in a Pediatric Cardiology Clinic between the years of 2014-2017 were reviewed retrospectively. Ten children (3 female, 7 male) were diagnosed with tachycardiomyopathy. The median age of the patients was 12 years (range: 4-15.8). Five had atrial tachycardia, two had ventricular tachycardia, the others had Mahaim fiber tachycardia, permanent junctional reciprocating tachycardia and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. Seven patients had catheter ablation and three patients who had previous heart surgery were treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. Median ejection fraction was 33% (range: 10-48), median left ventricle end-diastolic diameter was 55 mm (range: 30-78). All showed complete recovery with median ejection fraction 60% (range: 55- 78). Two patient with severe heart failure required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, one of them had ventricular assist device support but the device was removed after successful ablation. After two years this patient required permanent pacemaker implantation due to complete atrioventricular block. Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy is a rare and treatable cause of heart failure. Early recognition is critical, aggressive treatment aimed at controlling the arrhythmia results in symptom resolution and recovery of ventricular function.",

        "abstract": "\nThe contextual interference (CI) effect of motor skill has been demonstrated through numerous studies. However, few studies have reported on daily living tasks in patients with stroke. This study investigated the CI effect on spooning training in such patients. Fourteen right hemiparetic patients with stroke were assigned to one of two groups: a group with a random practice schedule or a group with a blocked practice schedule. The spooning task involved scooping go stones from a bowl 30&#160;cm away in 3 different directions to a bowl in front of the patient. We evaluated the acquisition, retention, and transfer of motor learning for spooning. The transfer was evaluated while participants ate cereal in a bowl with a spoon. Upper extremity function, defined as far-transfer, was also evaluated using the box-and-block test. In the retention test, no significant difference between random and blocked practice groups was shown, although both groups showed differences between pre-test and post-test movement times. However, in the transfer test, the random practice group had a significantly shorter movement time than the blocked practice group and also revealed improvement between the pre- and follow-up tests. Additionally, in the far-transfer test, there were significant differences between the pre- and post-, and pre- and follow-up tests only in the random practice group. These findings show that the benefits of CI for transfer can be applied to the learning of feeding skills in patients with stroke and that although the blocked practice is also partially beneficial to long-lasting skill learning in a treatment setting, it may not be efficient under changed conditions. We also suggest the possibility that feeding training with the CI effect could apply to not only transfer but also to far-transfer.",

The aim of the study was to investigate whether APAs could be improved in people with stroke as a result of targeted exercise involving their unaffected upper extremity. Nine individuals with stroke and five healthy control individuals participated in the laboratory tests before and after a single session of practice consisting of pushing a medicine ball attached to the ceiling and stopping the ball with their palm when it returns. The tests included self-initiated perturbations induced by fast, discrete shoulder flexion movements and external perturbations induced by a pendulum impact. Bilateral EMG activity of eight trunk and leg muscles was recorded and analyzed during the anticipatory phase of postural control. Significantly early APAs onsets (p&#160;<&#160;.05) were seen in trunk and leg muscles after a single session of practice as compared to pre-practice in both the groups and individuals with stroke improved their ability to generate APAs more than control group. While the improvement was more pronounced on the unaffected side of the body, enhanced APAs were recorded on the affected side as well. The observed practice-related earlier activations of muscles confirm a possibility of APA enhancement in individuals with stroke. The outcome provides a background for the development of balance rehabilitation protocols focused on improvement of anticipatory postural adjustments in individuals with neurological disorders.",

        "abstract": "\nCarotid artery images indicate any presence of plaque content, which may lead to atherosclerosis and stroke. Early identification of the disease is possible by taking B-mode ultrasound images in the carotid artery. Speckle is the inherent noise content in the ultrasound images, which essentially needs to be minimized.\nThe objective of the proposed method is to convert the multiplicative speckle noise into additive, after which the frequency transformations can be applied.\nThe method uses simple differentiation and integral calculus and is named variable gradient summation. It differs from the conventional homomorphic filter, by preserving the edge features to a great extent and better denoising. The additive image is subjected to wavelet decomposition and further speckle filtering with three different filters Non Local Means (NLM), Vectorial Total Variation (VTV) and Block Matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) algorithms. By this approach, the components dependent on the image are identified and the unwanted noise content existing in the high frequency portion of the image is removed.\nExperiments conducted on a set of 300 B-mode ultrasound carotid artery images and the simulation results prove that the proposed method of denoising gives enhanced results as compared to the conventional process in terms of the performance evaluation methods like peak signal to noise ratio, mean square error, mean absolute error, root mean square error, structural similarity, quality factor, correlation and image enhancement factor.",

The perceived frequency of physical restraint, mutual support, and culture of blame were measured. We predefined a high frequency physical restraint use group and compared the institutional characteristics, human resources, mutual support, and culture of blame between this group and the others (the control).\nThree hundred and thirty-three responses were analyzed. The mean number of beds per nurse was not significantly different between the groups; the mean and percentage of positive responses about mutual support and a culture of blame were significantly lower in the high frequency physical restraint use group. After adjusting variables in a multivariable regression analysis, a less positive response about the culture of blame was the only independent factor to predict high frequency physical restraint use.\nThe study suggests that changing the culture of blame, rather than increasing the number of nurses, is important for reducing physical restraint use.",

Advisory board meetings were arranged to develop the practice guidelines specific to the Indian context, for the use of EN in dysglycemic critically ill patients and to overcome challenges in this field.\nTwo advisory board meetings were organized to review various existing guidelines, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled trials and review articles, for their contextual relevance and strength. Three rounds of Delphi voting were done to arrive at consensus on certain recommendations. A systematic grading of practice guidelines by the advisory board was done based on strength of the consensus voting and reviewed supporting evidences.\nBased on the literature review, the recommendations for developing the practice guidelines were made as per the grading criteria agreed upon by the advisory board. The recommendations were to address challenges regarding prediction and assessment of dysglycemia (DG), acceptable glycemic targets in such settings, general nutritional aspects pertaining to DG nutrition, and nutrition in various superspecialty cases in critical care settings, where DG is commonly encountered.\nThis paper summarizes the optimum EN practices for managing DG in critically ill patients. The practical solutions to overcome the challenges in this field are presented as practice guidelines at the end of each section. These guidelines are expected to provide guidance for EN management in dysglycemic critically ill patients. These guidelines also outline the model glycemic control task force and its roles in nutrition care as well as an intensive care unit DG nutrition protocol.\nMehta Y, Mithal A, Kulkarni A, Reddy BR, Sharma J, Dixit S, et al.

Although the literature on upper-limb rehabilitation with robots shows increasing evidence of its effectiveness in stroke survivors, the length of time for which the re-learned motor abilities could be maintained is still understudied. A randomized controlled follow-up study was conducted on 48 subacute stroke patients who performed the upper-limb therapy using a planar end-effector robotic system (Experimental Group-EG) or TT (Control Group-CG). The clinical assessments were collected at T0 (baseline), T1 (end of treatment) and T2 (6 months follow-up): Upper Limb part of Fugl-Meyer assessment (FM-UL), total passive Range Of Motion (pROM), Modified Ashworth Scale Shoulder (MAS-S) and Elbow (MAS-E). At T1, the intra-group analysis showed significant gain of FM-UL in both EG and CG, while significant improvement in MAS-S, MAS-E, and pROM were found in the EG only. At T2, significant increase in MAS-S were revealed only in the CG. In FM-UL, pROM and MAS-E the improvements obtained at the end of treatment seem to be maintained at 6 months follow-up in both groups. The inter-groups analysis of FM-UL values at T1 and T2 demonstrated significant differences in favour of EG. In conclusion, upper limb Robot-assisted Therapy may lead a greater reduction of motor impairment in subacute stroke patients compared to Traditional Therapy. The gains observed at the end of treatment persisted over time. No serious adverse events related to the study occurred.",

The potential of trimethylamine N-oxide and its related compounds as biomarkers for various cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, stroke, thrombosis, and heart failure, was recently highlighted, which was the driving force behind the development of an analytical method to identify trimethylamine N-oxide and eight related compounds in dried blood spots. In the proposed method, a novel \"on-spot reaction\" approach was introduced to overcome the low loading efficiency of trimethylamine in dried blood spots. Upon the addition of 50&#160;&#956;L of blood onto the filter paper pretreated with dilute HCl, an acid-base neutralization reaction in the blood spots transformed the volatile trimethylamine to a salt. Next, a punched disc with a diameter of 6.0&#160;mm was eluted by agitation with 20&#160;mM ammonium formate for 10&#160;min and derivatized with 1.0&#160;M ethyl bromoacetate at 80&#160;&#176;C for 60&#160;min. A surrogate analyte approach was employed for quantification of these endogenous compounds in the complex matrix. Analysis was carried out using zwitterionic hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. The established method was validated and applied to monitor real samples from 30 clinical cases. The proposed new methodology based on dried blood spots could greatly improve the convenience, analytical sensitivity, and selectivity of cardiovascular disease testing.",

Current guidelines from the French drug agency recommend treating with a statin after an ischaemic stroke to a target of less than 100 mg/dL, but no study directly tested LDL-c targets. The Treat Stroke to Target (TST) trial will compare the efficacy of achieving an LDL-c of less than 70 mg/dL versus an achieved LDL-c of 100&#8201;&#177;&#8201;10 mg/dL for secondary prevention in patients with recent ischaemic stroke of atherosclerotic origin.Main hypothesis: An achieved on-treatment LDL-c of less than 70 mg/dL will reduce by 25% the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke, myocardial infarction, urgent coronary or carotid revascularisation following new symptoms requiring hospitalisation, and vascular death compared with on-treatment LDL-c of 100&#8201;&#177;&#8201;10 mg/dL.\nPatients are randomised to either LDL-c levels, and the investigator who is not blinded can use the lipid-lowering agent of his/her choice available on the market (including statins and ezetimibe), in order to achieve the assigned LDL-c level. To be eligible for enrolment, patients have a recent ischaemic stroke or TIA of atherosclerotic origin with at least one arterial stenosis of a cerebral artery, enrolled between acute phase of the qualifying stroke (once the neurological deficit is stabilised) and three months. The initial planned sample size of 3760 participants followed three years was amended to allow follow-up of all enrolled patients until 385 primary efficacy outcome events have occurred, and no later than 31 December 2019. Patients will be recruited in 76 sites in two countries (France and South Korea) between March 2010 and December 2018 (last included patient followed up to one year). Safety outcomes will include haemorrhagic strokes and new onset diabetes. All primary endpoints will be adjudicated by an endpoint committee, blinded to the assigned LDL-c level. Two sub-studies assess (1) the relative effect of assigned LDL-c levels on occurrence of new atherosclerotic plaque as detected by carotid ultrasound during follow-up, using M'ATH software for repositioning and (2) the genetic and biomarker drivers of recurrent primary endpoints according to assigned LDL-c lowering arm, in atherosclerotic strokes.\nThe TST trial is evaluating the benefits of achieving an LDL-c less than 70 mg/dL for secondary stroke prevention in ischaemic stroke patients of atherosclerotic origin.

We aimed to assess the current status of women in European Stroke Organisation, and to explore the change in sex differences after the introduction of focused approaches to address disparities in 2014.\nUsing organisational records, we collected data on sex differences in core activities from 2008 up to 2017 including membership, participation in conferences, courses and in the official journal of the society, and positions of seniority and leadership. We estimated sex distribution differences in each of the activities from 2014 to date.\nIn 2017, the proportion of female members was 40%, while 24% of fellows, 22% of the executive board and 19% of the editorial board in the official journal of the society were women.

The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) does not include acute vestibular syndrome, and early computed tomography scanning cannot rule out acute ischaemia. A positive Head Impulse-Nystagmus-Test of Skew (HINTS) test suggests posterior circulation stroke in acute vestibular syndrome when any of three signs are present: normal horizontal head impulse, gaze-direction nystagmus or eye skew deviation. This systematic review examined the accuracy of positive HINTS in identifying posterior circulation stroke in acute vestibular syndrome patients.\nWe searched MEDLINE (1966 to 21 December 2017), EMBASE (1980 to December 2017), Web of Science and scanned bibliographies. Two authors independently screened relevant articles and extracted data. We included studies where HINTS was used to identify posterior circulation stroke with diagnosis confirmed using magnetic resonance imaging.\nSix studies (n&#8201;=&#8201;644 patients) were identified. Acute stroke was confirmed in 200 (31.1%) patients. There was a 15-fold increased risk of posterior circulation stroke in patients with positive HINTS test compared to those with no abnormality (RR: 15.84, 95% CI: 5.25-47.79). For any stroke, the pooled sensitivity was 95.5% (95% CI: 92.6-98.4%) and specificity was 71.2% (95% CI: 67.0-75.4%).\nThe data suggest that the HINTS test as one element of clinical evaluation is useful to differentiate posterior circulation stroke from peripheral causes in acute vestibular syndrome.

The aim of this guideline is to provide recommendations on antithrombotic medication for secondary prevention of stroke and other vascular outcomes in these patients. The working group identified questions and outcomes, graded evidence, and developed recommendations according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) standard operating procedure for guidelines. The guideline was reviewed and approved by the ESO guideline board and the ESO executive committee. In patients with atrial fibrillation and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of recurrence over antiplatelets or no antithrombotic treatment. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are preferred over vitamin K antagonists because they have a lower risk of major bleeding and death. Recommendations are weak regarding timing of treatment, (re-)starting oral anticoagulants in patients with previous intracerebral haemorrhage, and treatment in specific patient subgroups of those of older age, with cognitive impairment, renal failure or small vessel disease, because of a lack of strong evidence. In conclusion, for patients with atrial fibrillation and ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are the preferred treatment for secondary prevention of recurrent stroke or thromboembolism. Further research is required to determine the best timing for initiating oral anticoagulants after an acute ischemic stroke, whether or not oral anticoagulants should be (re)started in patients with a history of intracerebral haemorrhage, and the best secondary preventive treatment in specific subgroups.",

While right ventricular assist device (RVAD) has been considered recently as a treatment option for the end-stage PAH patients, its effects on biventricular mechanics are, however, largely unknown. To address this issue, we developed an image-based modeling framework consisting of a biventricular finite element (FE) model that is coupled to a lumped model describing the pulmonary and systemic circulations in a closed-loop system. The biventricular geometry was reconstructed from the magnetic resonance images of two PAH patients showing different degree of RV remodeling and a normal subject. The framework was calibrated to match patient-specific measurements of the left ventricular (LV) and RV volume and pressure waveforms. An RVAD model was incorporated into the calibrated framework and simulations were performed with different pump speeds. Results showed that RVAD unloads the RV, improves cardiac output and increases septum curvature, which are more pronounced in the PAH patient with severe RV remodeling. These improvements, however, are also accompanied by an adverse increase in the PA pressure. These results suggest that the RVAD implantation may need to be optimized depending on disease progression.",

Thirty-day mortality was 2 (3.1%).\nMitral annular calcification is present in a significant percentage of patients with mitral regurgitation, especially in Barlow's disease, including younger patients. By using a variety of repair techniques, totally endoscopic robotic mitral valve repair can be performed safely and effectively in most mitral annular calcification cases with a noncalcified posterior leaflet.",

        "abstract": "\nCompensatory approaches to rehabilitation of vision loss as a result of brain injury are aimed at improving the efficacy of eye movements, enabling patients to bring the otherwise unseen stimuli into their sighted field. Eye movement training has shown promise in a large number of studies in small clinical populations. Nevertheless, there remain two problems; standardisation and wide accessibility. NeuroEyeCoach&#8482; (NEC) has been developed to address both. The therapy is based on the visual search approach and is adaptive to the patient's level of disability and the task difficulty is varied systematically through a combination of set-size and target/distractor similarity. Importantly, the therapy can be accessed online or in clinical settings, to enhance accessibility. Here we have reported on the findings from the first 296 consecutive cases who have accessed and completed NEC online, the largest cohort of patients studied to date. Patients' performance on two objective (visual search times and errors) and one subjective (self-reported disability) measures of performance were assessed before and after therapy. The findings showed that patients improved in search time, had less errors and improved disability scores in 87% (255/294), 80% (236/294) and 66% (167/254) of all cases respectively. We examined factors age, sex, side of blindness, age at the onset of brain injury, and time elapsed between the brain injury and start of therapy as predictors of both objective and subjective measures of improvements. Age was a significant predictor of improved search errors with older patients showing larger improvements. Time between brain injury and intervention negatively influenced search reaction time, however, none of the factors could predict improved subjective reports of disability.",

Our objective is to determine the efficacy and safety of TXA in other surgeries associated with a high risk for red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. We identified randomized controlled trials in Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, and CAB abstracts from inception to June 2019. We included trials evaluating intraoperative IV TXA in adult patients undergoing a non-cardiac and non-hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries at high-risk for RBC transfusion, defined as a baseline transfusion rate &#8805;5% in comparator arm. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. We used GRADE methodology to assess certainty of evidence. From 8565 citations identified, we included 69 unique trials, enrolling 6157 patients. TXA reduces both the proportion of patients transfused RBCs (relative risk (RR) 0.59; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 0.72; low certainty evidence) and the volume of RBC transfused (MD -0.51 RBC units; 95%CI -0.13 to -0.9 units; low certainty evidence) when compared to placebo or usual care. TXA was not associated with differences in deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, all-cause mortality, hospital length of stay, need for re-operation due to hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, stroke or seizure. In patients undergoing a broad range of non-cardiac and non-hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries at high risk for RBC transfusion, perioperative TXA reduced exposure to RBC transfusion. No differences in thrombotic outcomes were identified; however, summary effect estimates were limited by lack of systemic screening and short duration of follow-up.",

We examined the impact of AM versus PM operative time on surgical outcomes of CABG and AVR in a diverse, multi-institutional cardiac surgery network between January 2008 and September 2018.\nThe AM group included patients whose surgery start time was between 6:30 and 9 AM, whereas noon to 2:30 PM was considered PM (8901 AM/1962 PM) for CABG and (2598 AM/617 PM) for AVR. Because of imbalances in sample size, risk factors, and Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk between groups, propensity score matching using all baseline characteristics was used to create 2 well-matched patient groups whose outcomes were compared.\nAfter propensity score matching, there was no difference in mortality, stroke, prolonged ventilation, renal failure, deep sternal wound infection, reoperation, myocardial injury, atrial fibrillation, or readmission between AM and PM groups for both isolated CABG and AVR. However, there were mixed differences noted in intensive care unit length of stay, postoperative length of stay, blood product use, and crossclamp time.

We have taken the approach of respecting the native geometric orientation of the repaired BAV leaflets when creating the aortic neoroot during valve-sparing root reimplantation (VSRR) procedures. We investigated midterm outcomes with this 2-prong approach for VSRR in BAV syndrome.\nOf 72 patients in a prospectively maintained BAV repair database, 68 met inclusion criteria: 36 patients had 180&#176;/180&#176; neoroot geometry, and 32 patients had 150&#176;/210&#176; orientation.

To establish a standardized approach for these patients, we compared hemorrhagic complications and clinical outcomes in patients on DOAC medication, patients on vitamin K antagonists (VKA), and patients without preoperative anticoagulation.\nAll 3 groups underwent major cardiac surgery and were retrospectively analyzed: patients on DOAC were advised to take their last DOAC dose 4&#160;days before hospital admission, and DOAC plasma levels were measured the day before surgery. In patients with plasma levels of >30&#160;ng/mL, surgery was postponed until plasma level was below this threshold level.

In that case it should be managed and relieved. The aim: To conduct standardization of determination of degrees of spasticity by means of foregoing scales and methodologies with further comparison of their sensitiveness and objectivity of the obtained data.\n24 patients with post-stroke spasticity were treated during 14 days using the same centrally acting anti-spastic drug (oral tolperisone hydrochloride). The average duration of spasticity was 25 months (minimum 20 months and maximum 36 months). 24 patients were rated on the Modified Ashworth Scale and of those patients: 1 was rated stage &#8220;1&#8221;, 5 &#8211; stage &#8220;1+&#8221;, 7 &#8211; stage &#8220;2&#8221;, 7 &#8211; stage &#8220;3&#8221; and 3 patients were rated stage &#8220;4&#8221;. Assessment of muscle tone for each patient was performed daily during morning round. At our study we have used the Modified Ashworth Scale, the Modified Tardieu Scale, Functional Independence Measure, Visual Analog Scale for Pain and some parameters from ENMG study (Hoffmann&#8217;s reflex and F/M max measured for ulnar nerve at the side of paresis). The results were statistically analyzed through Microsoft Excel 2010 using Student&#8217;s method and Spearman&#8217;s rank correlation coefficient. P value less that 0,05 was considered as a significant level.\nAccording to collected statistics we can advise for control of treatment of post-stroke spasticity using ENMG parameters and Visual Analog Scale for Pain during first 7 days of treatment, using of Modified Ashworth Scale and Tardieu Scale is more appropriate starting on 7th day of taking anti-spastic medications. Unfortunately, according to gathered statistics there is no correlation between Modified Ashworth Scale and parameters of ENMG.\nFor the estimation of efficiency of post-stroke spasticity treatment in the first 7 days of the therapy more informative are electroneuromyographic parameters and Visual Analog Scale. Muscle tone assessment scales (Modified Ashworth Scale and Modified Tardieu Scale) for the monitoring of dynamic changes of efficiency of the treatment can be recommended beginning from the seventh day of the therapy.",

However, TTR has not been previously characterised in Indigenous Australians who experience a greater burden of AF and stroke.\nIndigenous and non-Indigenous Australians with AF on warfarin anticoagulation therapy were identified from a large tertiary referral centre between 1999 and 2012. Time in therapeutic range was calculated as a proportion of daily international normalised ratio (INR) values between 2 and 3 for non-valvular AF and 2.5 to 3.5 for valvular AF. INR values between tests were imputed using the Rosendaal technique. Linear regression models were employed to characterise predictors of TTR.\nFive hundred and twelve (512) patients with AF on warfarin were included (88 Indigenous and 424 non-Indigenous). Despite younger age (51&#177;13 vs 71&#177;12 years, p<0.001), Indigenous Australians had greater valvular heart disease, diabetes, and alcohol excess compared to non-Indigenous Australians (p<0.05 for all). Time in therapeutic range was significantly lower in Indigenous compared to non-Indigenous Australians (40&#177;29 vs 50&#177;31%, p=0.006). Univariate predictors of poorer TTR included Indigenous ethnicity, younger age, diuretic use, and comorbidities, such as valvular heart disease, heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (p<0.05 for all). Valvular heart disease remained a significant predictor of poorer TTR in multivariate analyses (p=0.004).\nIndigenous Australians experience particularly poor warfarin anticoagulation quality. Our data also suggest that many non-Indigenous Australians spend suboptimal time in therapeutic range.

        "abstract": "\nTo help hemiplegic patients with stroke to restore impaired or lost upper extremity functionalities efficiently, the design of upper limb rehabilitation robotics which can substitute human practice becomes more important. The aim of this work is to propose a powered exoskeleton for upper limb rehabilitation based on a wheelchair in order to increase the frequency of training and reduce the preparing time per training. This paper firstly analyzes the range of motion (ROM) of the flexion/extension, adduction/abduction, and internal/external of the shoulder joint, the flexion/extension of the elbow joint, the pronation/supination of the forearm, the flexion/extension and ulnar/radial of the wrist joint by measuring the normal people who are sitting on a wheelchair. Then, a six-degree-of-freedom exoskeleton based on a wheelchair is designed according to the defined range of motion. The kinematics model and workspace are analyzed to understand the position of the exoskeleton. In the end, the test of ROM of each joint has been done. The maximum error of measured and desired shoulder flexion and extension joint angle is 14.98%. The maximum error of measured and desired elbow flexion and extension joint angle is 14.56%. It is acceptable for rehabilitation training. Meanwhile, the movement of drinking water can be realized in accordance with the range of motion. It demonstrates that the proposed upper limb exoskeleton can also assist people with upper limb disorder to deal with activities of daily living. The feasibility of the proposed powered exoskeleton for upper limb rehabilitation training and function compensating based on a wheelchair is proved.",

        "title": "Could nutritional therapy take us further in our approaches to Fabry disease?",
        "abstract": "\nFabry disease (FD) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene that result in deficiency of enzyme &#945;-galactosidase A activity. Clinical manifestation varies from mild to severe depending on the phenotype. The main clinical manifestations are cutaneous (angiokeratomas), neurologic (acroparesthesias), gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain), renal (proteinuria and kidney failure), cardiovascular (cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias), and cerebrovascular (stroke). Enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human &#945;-galactosidase is currently the therapeutic option for FD. Although enzyme replacement therapy has changed the natural history of disease, many clinical aspects of FD require an additional specific treatment. Nutritional approach is mostly indicated in case of nephropathy and gastrointestinal symptoms. Specific dietary interventions can modulate some pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease, such as the inflammation, oxidative stress, and autophagic disorders. However, to our knowledge, limited attention has been given to the nutritional aspects of FD. The aim of this review is to examine nutritional strategies that might interfere with several pathophysiologic aspects of FD, including inflammation and oxidative stress. A dietary approach should be part of the basic treatment in renal manifestations of FD. Dietary measures recommended for irritable bowel syndrome could be recommended for gastrointestinal symptoms. Dietary factors can modulate the inflammation, oxidative stress, and autophagy involved in FD. Polyphenols, &#969;-3 fatty acids, microbiota, and specific dietary patterns can interfere with inflammation/oxidative stress and autophagy mechanisms and could also contribute to the slowing of FD progression.",

To date, however, little is known about the relationship between performance of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) and cognitive stages in PD, and there are conflicting reports as to whether declines in specific cognitive domains predict IADL impairment.\nParticipants with PD were drawn from the Pacific Udall Center and included in the study if both participant and study partner IADL ratings and cognitive tests were completed (n = 192). Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine whether participant and/or study partner rating predicted mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Correlations are reported for the relationship between participant/study partner IADL reports as well as for specific cognitive tests.\nAlthough both participant and study partner ratings of IADL performance were associated with a diagnosis of PD with dementia, only participant self-rating of functional ability was significantly associated with a diagnosis of PD with mild cognitive impairment. Functional ability correlated most strongly with measures of processing speed, auditory working memory, and immediate verbal recall for both the participant and study partner ratings.\nFor participants with PD in the early stages of cognitive decline, self-rating may be more sensitive to the impact of cognitive changes on IADL function than ratings made by a knowledgeable study partner. Changes in executive function, processing speed, and learning may indicate a higher likelihood of IADL impairment. Careful assessment of cognition and IADL performance is recommended to permit individualized interventions prior to significant disability.",

The prevalence of each metabolic syndrome component in the intracranial arteriosclerosis group was higher than those of the extracranial arteriosclerosis and the control groups. The average component values in the intracranial arteriosclerosis group was higher than those observed in other groups. The prevalence rate of metabolic syndrome had no significant difference among different degrees of stenosis for extracranial arteriosclerosis group. There was a remarkable correlation between intracranial arteriosclerosis and metabolic syndrome (P<0.001), while no correlation was detected between extracranial arteriosclerosis and metabolic syndrome (P<0.001). We concluded that metabolic syndrome may increase the prevalence risk of intracranial arteriosclerosis. There was a significant correlation between intracranial arteriosclerosis and metabolic syndrome components including hyperglycemia and hypertension. Also, there was a significant correlation between extracranial arteriosclerosis and metabolic syndrome components including hyperglycemia.\nWe believe that at least three components of metabolic syndrome can obviously increase the risk of intracranial arteriosclerosis.",

Thanks to technological progress and higher quality of non-invasive neuroimaging methods, these pathologies can be investigated sooner and treated earlier. Due to the controversy surrounding invasive treatment of these pathologies, the aim of the study was to analyse methods of treatment, their outcome, and complications in a group of patients with VSIAs.\nOut of 444 cases of intracranial aneurysms treated in our centre, 65 aneurysms met the radiological criteria of VSIAs. The parameters - width and length of the aneurysm's neck and width, length, and height of the aneurysm's dome - were measured. The analysed parameters were as follows: symptoms upon admission and after treatment, days in hospital, and intraoperative complications. Clinical and radiological intensity of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) was evaluated by using the Hunt-Hess and Fisher scales. The degree of embolisation of the aneurysm after the procedure was assessed using the Montreal Scale. Clinical outcome was assessed by Glasgow Outcome Scale.\n50.77% of VSIAs were treated with endovascular procedures and 49.23% with neurosurgical clipping. SAH was presented in 38.46% of patients with VSIAs. Intraoperative complications were presented in 16.92% of patients with VSIAs, and the most common complication was ischaemic stroke. Stents were used in 51.52% of VSIAs. In 69.70% of embolisation procedures at VSIAs complete obliteration was achieved. The average result in the Montreal Scale was 1.31 (SD = 0.66).\nVSIAs can be treated as effectively and safely as larger aneurysms, by both endovascular and surgical methods.",

We aimed at investigating the effects of excitatory rTMS, given as intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) over left Wernicke's area, on auditory comprehension in patients suffering from fluent aphasia after stroke of the left temporal lobe. Methods: We studied 13 patients with chronic fluent aphasia after an ischemic stroke involving Wernicke's area. iTBS was applied in random order to Wernicke's area, the right-hemisphere homologous of Wernicke's area, and the primary visual cortex. Auditory comprehension was blind assessed using the Token test before (T0), 5 (T1), and 40 min (T2) after a single session of iTBS. Results: At the first evaluation (T1) after iTBS on left Wernike's area, but not on the contralateral homologous area nor on the primary visual cortex, the scores on the Token test were significantly increased. No significant effects were observed at T2. Conclusion: We demonstrated that a single session of excitatory iTBS over Wernicke's area was safe and led to a transient facilitation of auditory comprehension in chronic stroke patients with lesions in the same area. Further studies are needed to establish whether TBS-induced modulation can be enhanced and transformed into longer-lasting effects by means of repeated TBS sessions and by combining TBS with speech and language therapy.",

This case report describes a female presenting acutely with a stroke and, initially, no evidence of LR. Her antiphospholipid antibodies were negative, and her neuroimaging revealed multiple territory strokes with extensive vasculopathy and fragile neo-formed vessel collateralisation. She had progressive memory loss and multiple transient ischaemic attacks on a background of established infarctions. SS should be considered in any idiopathic medium-vessel vasculopathy despite the absence of LR. Medical therapy can be challenging and the importance of antiphospholipid status in risk stratifying anticoagulation against antiplatelet therapy is discussed with a proposed rheumatology management strategy. The medical option of hydroxychloroquine should be considered in all patients in view of its anti-thrombotic properties and efficacy in diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome with the suggestion that SS may be a forme fruste of these diseases. Neurosurgical options should be considered for recurrent transient neurological symptoms. For our patient, this included an extracranial to intracranial bypass via a radial artery graft for haemodynamic stroke management confirmed on SPECT imaging. The traditional hallmark of SS has previously been LR. This case highlights an atypical presentation stressing the importance of diagnostic vigilance in a patient with an idiopathic medium-vessel vasculopathy, together with balancing the medical risk of antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation and thrombolysis whilst revealing possible neurosurgical options in select SS patients.",

A subset of patients is diagnosed at initial cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) with a massively dilated RV, far beyond pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) criteria, which is unlikely to return to normal size after PVR. This study aimed to identify risk factors for massive RV dilation at initial CMR. This nested case-control study included all patients at our institution with rTOF and massive RV dilation (indexed RV end-diastolic volume [RVEDVi] &#8805;200 ml/m2) on initial CMR. Patients were matched by age at first CMR, gender, and type of repair with rTOF controls with RVEDVi<200 ml/m2. In 39 cases (median RVEDVi 227 ml/m2, interquartile range [IQR] 213 to 250) and 73 controls (median RVEDVi 155 ml/m2, IQR 130 to 169), repair at >6 months of age, longer QRS duration, and non-Caucasian race were significantly associated with massive RV dilation on univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, repair at >6 months of age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12 to 7.55, p&#8239;=&#8239;0.03), longer QRS duration (AOR&#8239;=&#8239;1.03, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.05, p&#8239;=&#8239;0.005), and non-Caucasian race (AOR&#8239;=&#8239;7.84, 95% CI 1.76 to 34.8, p&#8239;=&#8239;0.01) remained independently associated with massive RV dilation. Era of repair, history of systemic to pulmonary shunt palliation, genetic anomaly, and additional cardiac lesions did not differ between groups. In conclusion, these risk factors identify a subset of patients who may benefit from earlier CMR evaluation to avoid massive irreversible RV dilation.",

Detailed measures of treatment response are compounded by a dearth of information that examine brain connections that contribute to clinical improvement. In this study we measure alterations to cortical connectivity pathways during a therapy paradigm to detect whether key brain connections that contribute to language recovery can be detected prior to therapy.\nWe conducted a case-control trial with twenty-three adults including eight adults with chronic, post-stroke aphasia. Aphasia patients underwent 12 naming therapy sessions over 4 weeks, consisting of semantic and phonological treatment approaches. High-density electroencephalography (128 channel EEG) was measured prior to therapy and immediately following treatment in patients with aphasia. Analysis via a dynamic causal modelling (DCM) was used to assess which cortical connections significantly correlated with therapy response.\nAltered cortical responses in aphasia patients measured bilaterally in a dual stream DCM connectivity model were predictive of treatment-induced improvement in naming. Pre-treatment DCM coupling (i.e., strength of cortical connections) significant correlated with naming improvement for items treated with semantic therapy, as indicated by increased connection strengths between left inferior parietal lobule (LIPL) and inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG, r&#160;=&#160;.63, pFDR&#160;=&#160;.016).

        "abstract": "\nNaming and word retrieval deficits are two of the most persistent symptoms in chronic post-stroke aphasia. Naming success or failure on specific words can sometimes be predicted by the psycholinguistic properties of the word. Despite a wealth of literature investigating the influence of psycholinguistic properties in neuro-typical and clinical language processing, the underlying structure of these properties and their relation to the fundamental language components and neural correlates are unexplored. In this study, a multivariate data-decomposition approach was used to identify the underlying structure within a collection of psycholinguistic properties (word imageability, frequency, age-of-acquisition, familiarity, length, semantic diversity and phonological neighbourhood density) and their influence on naming accuracy was explored in a cohort of 42 participants with a diverse range of chronic post-stroke aphasia classifications and severities. The results extracted three principal psycholinguistic factors, which were best described as 'lexical usage', 'semantic clarity' and 'phonological complexity'. Furthermore, a novel approach was used to systematically relate the influence of these psycholinguistic properties to participants' neuropsychological and lesion profiles. The findings did not show a one-to-one mapping between psycholinguistic features and core language components. 'Lexical usage' was the only factor that showed a significant difference between fluent versus non-fluent aphasia groups in terms of the influence of this lexical factor on successful naming, and it was the only factor that was related to the pattern of patients' brain lesions. Voxel-wise whole brain lesion-symptom mapping identified left frontal regions, aligning with previous evidence that these regions are related to language production functions, including word retrieval and repetition. The evidence from the current study suggests that the functional locus of psycholinguistic properties is distributed across multiple language components rather than being localised to a single language element.",

        "abstract": "\nThe effects of swallowing therapy (ST) on long-term clinical outcomes in patients with post-stroke dysphagia (PSD) remain unclear.\nThis study explores the effect of ST, initiated within 6 months of the stroke onset, on long-term pneumonia-free and overall survival rates in PSD patients.\nRetrospective cohort study.\nLongitudinal Health Insurance Database.\nThe study included 2994 eligible PSD patients between 2005 and 2013.\nAmong the scrutinized PSD patients, ST was initiated during the nasogastric intubation (NGI) period and was implemented by physician discretion. Therefore, subjects who underwent ST were classified into the ST-intervention (STI) group and those without ST were classified into the non-ST (NST) group. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to match age, sex, pneumonia events during the NGI period, the Charlson comorbidity index, and the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale between the two groups. We started to follow all selected PSD patients 6 months after the onset of stroke for four years. Multivariable adjusted Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier estimations were conducted to assess the effects of ST and the ST duration on pneumonia-free and overall survival.\nOverall, 1497 PSD patients aged approximately 68 years in each group were selected in this study. The pneumonia-free survival rate in STI subjects was 57.4% and was significantly greater (P=0.003) than that (54.2%) in NST subjects during the follow-up (F/U). A significantly improved (P<0.0001) overall survival rate was observed in STI subjects (75.0%) compared to NST subjects (63.7%) during the F/U. In STI subjects, ST duration &#8805; 1 month was significantly (P=0.009) associated with reduced pneumonia incidence compared to those with ST duration<1 month.\nParticipation of ST within 6 months of the stroke onset is associated with decreased pneumonia incidence and improved long-term survival in selected PSD patients. In the selected STI subjects, longer ST duration may be valuable in pneumonia prevention.\nThis study reveals that ST initiated within 6 months of the stroke onset may be associated with improved long-term survival in selected PSD patients.",

For validation, we compared the frequency estimation of the tremor obtained with Tremoroton compared with a commercially available software in a cohort of 20 patients (10 with essential tremor and 10 with Parkinson diagnosis), comparing the activity recorded on the accelerometer, extensor carpi radialis and flexor carpi radialis EMG. An intraclass correlation coefficient was used for the comparison.\nThe final version of tremoroton is now online. It allows reading up to 6 channels, and will do time, frequency, time-frequency analysis and calculate coherence.

        "abstract": "\nStroke is associated with multiple forms of disability, including dysphagia. Post-stroke dysphagia increases the risks of pneumonia and mortality and often results in cessation of oral feeding. However, appropriate rehabilitation methods can eventually lead to resumption of oral food intake. This study tried to clarify that re-initiating oral food intake could modify the composition of oral/gut microbial communities in patients with dysphagia. From 78 patients with sub-acute stage of stroke, 11 complete tube feeding subjects without taking antibiotics were enrolled and received rehabilitation for re-initiation of oral food intake, and 8 subjects were brought back to complete oral feeding. Oral and gut microbiota community profiles were evaluated using 16S rRNA sequencing of the saliva and feces samples before and after re-initiation of oral food intake in patients recovering from enteral nutrition under the same nutrient condition. Standard nutrition in the hospital was 1,840 kcal, including protein = 75 g, fat = 45 g, and carbohydrates = 280 g both for tube and oral feeding subjects. Oral food intake increased oral and gut microbiome diversity and altered the composition of the microbiome. Oral and gut microbiome compositions were drastically different; however, the abundance of family Carnobacteriaceae and genus Granulicatella was increased in both the oral and gut microbiome after re-initiation of oral food intake. Although oral microbiota showed more significant changes than the gut microbiota, metagenome prediction revealed the presence of more differentially enriched pathways in the gut. In addition, simpler co-occurrence networks of oral and gut microbiomes, indicating improved dysbiosis of the microbiome, were observed during oral feeding as compared to that during tube feeding. Oral food intake affects oral and gut microbiomes in patients recovering from enteral nutrition. Rehabilitation for dysphagia can modify systemic health by increasing the diversity and altering the composition and co-occurrence network structure of oral and gut microbial communities.",

The study design was quasi-experimental in nature, observing the fluctuation/change in technical-tactical variables of the tennis players when playing a \"Tennis 10s Green Competition\" (GC) with the current federative rules and a redesigned competition \"Modified Competition\" (MC) including altered net height and court dimensions based on small-sided games (SSGs) and equipment scaling. Twenty U-10 tennis players were studied (age of players = 9.46 &#177; 0.66 years, average weekly training in tennis = 2.90 &#177; 1.07 h, years of experience = 3.65 &#177; 1.53 years). The results showed that in MC, there was a greater technical-tactical variability compared with the GC in terms of the following: (a) greater service effectiveness; (b) more situational and special strokes; and (c) a more equitable change in the distribution of hitting and ball landing locations. The values of MC showed that the current adaptation rules and equipment in federated U-10 competitions might not be enough to improve the teaching-learning process under the comprehensive approach. The current competition for U-10 tennis players (stage green) should be redesigned, in order to build an optimal process of affordances to develop a multidimensional positive impact during this training stage.",

        "abstract": "\nTrousseau's syndrome is known as a thromboembolic disorder due to hypercoagulation accompanied with advanced cancer. A 67-year-old man presented with disequilibrium and back pain, and magnetic resonance imaging of his brain indicated multiple cerebral infarctions at the acute stage. A computed tomography scan showed enlargement of multiple paraaortic lymph nodes. From these findings, we suspected that this patient had Trousseau's syndrome. The patient started anticoagulant treatment involving constant infusion with heparin Na. We also examined the origin of enlarged multiple paraaortic lymph nodes by investigating the tumor markers, which showed that the prostate specific antigen value (PSA) was extremely high. We conducted a prostatic biopsy and the pathological findings showed prostate cancer. The Combined Androgen Blockade (CAB) therapy was effective in reducing PSA value and shrinkage of the paraaortic lymph nodes. After the blood coagulation ability was improved to a normal state, we changed the anticoagulant treatment to subcutaneous injection of heparin Ca. There was no recurrence of cerebral infarction and no regrowth of prostate cancer 6 months after CAB therapy. Trousseau's syndrome is known as a poor prognosis syndrome because there is no effective therapy for the advanced stage of the accompanying cancer. However, CAB therapy is effective for advanced prostate cancer and long-term prognosis is expected. Starting anticoagulant treatment at the acute stage and maintaining anticoagulant treatment at the chronic stage are important in the treatment of Trousseau's syndrome accompanied with prostate cancer.",

Reports suggest that functional foods and nutraceutical ingredients might support patients to obtain the desired therapeutic blood pressure (BP) goals and reduce cardiovascular risks by modulating various risk factors such as oxidative stress, renin-angiotensin system hyperactivity, inflammation, hyperlipidemia, and vascular resistance. We review the recent clinical experiments that have evaluated the biological and pharmacological activities of several types of nutraceuticals, including sour tea, cocoa, common spices, vitamin C, vitamin E, lycopene, flavonoids, coenzyme Q10, milk's tripeptides, calcium, magnesium, polyunsaturated fatty acids, and prebiotics in preventing and treating HTN.

We determined that chungkookjang made with Sunchang Research Center for Fermentation Microbes 100730 and 100731 strains of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens(SRCM100730; CKJ730) and SRCM100731(CKJ731) protected against ischemic stroke and post-stroke hyperglycemia in Mongolian gerbils with ischemic stroke induced by transient occlusion of the carotid arteries. Gerbil fed 4.5% cooked soybeans (CSB), CKJ730, CKJ731, or cellulose (negative-control) in 40 energy% fat diets for 3&#8239;weeks, and then had artery occlusion for 8&#8239;min and continued taking the assigned diet for 5&#8239;weeks. CKJ730 and CKJ731 had thrombolytic activity and prevented neuronal cell death. Consequently, they improved short-term memory and spontaneous alteration compared to the negative-control. CKJ730 and CKJ731 improved neurological symptoms including drooped eyes, crouched posture, flexor reflex, and walking patterns the most among the stroke-induced gerbils. CKJ730 and CKJ731 increased active time, grip strength, and blood flow measured by Doppler compared to the negative-control. CKJ730 protected against post-stroke glucose dysregulation by restoring &#946;-cell mass in the gerbils with transient artery occlusion. Serum tumor necrosis factor-&#945; and interleukin-1&#946; levels were lower in CKJ730 and CKJ731 than the negative-control. CSB also improved glucose metabolism and suppressed inflammatory cytokines, but less than CKJ730 and CKJ731. Clostridia increased, and Bacteriodia slightly decreased in the negative-control group, compared to the normal-control. CKJ730 and CKJ731 changed the amounts of Bacteriodia and Clostridia to be similar to normal-control. In conclusion, the daily intake of chungkookjang fermented with B. amyloliquefaciens improved the gut microbiome, increased blood flow to the brain, suppressed systemic inflammation, and may reduce the susceptibility to injury from ischemic stroke in gerbils subjected to ischemic injury.",

Gene expression patterns at different time courses were screened by STEM tools. Then, function annotation and pathway enrichment of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were performed using the Gene Ontology (GO) database and the Kyoto Gene and Genomic Encyclopedia (KEGG) database. Depending on CEMiTool package, gene expression profile matrix was inputted into R to construct the co-expression networks and to analyze modules, and enrichment analysis was conducted to evaluate the correlation between the modules and different time points.\nComparing with gene at 0 h, the numbers of DEGs in peripheral blood at different time points after MCAO were 163 (1 h), 502 (2 h), 527 (3 h), 550 (6 h), and 75 (24 h), respectively. Moreover, a total of 38 gene expression patterns were enriched, and pattern 65 and pattern 34 were specifically up-regulated or down-regulated at 2-6 h. Hp, Nos2, P2ry10, and Klf12 were representative genes of these two models.

We hypothesized that postischemic supplementation of FA is beneficial for neuronal survival and regeneration. The objective of the present study was to determine the postischemic neuroprotective and neuroregenerative efficacy of FA supplementation and its effects on various cellular processes in vitro. This work benefited from the use of FA and glucose-free media to better assess the ischemic neuroprotection provided by FA supplementation. The postischemic supplementation of FA significantly improved cell viability, and the improvement was primarily by obstructing the oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-activated apoptosis. Furthermore, postischemic treatment with FA significantly reduced the mitochondrial membrane depolarization and the formation of acidic organelles triggered by OGD. Moreover, FA's effect on neuroregeneration following OGD was evaluated by measuring the cell proliferation and neurite outgrowth length. Treatment with FA enhanced cell proliferation and neurite outgrowth significantly. Thus, these results revealed some of the mechanisms by which FA supplementation provided neuroprotection and neuroregeneration following ischemic injury and highlighted the need for further research into the potential of folic acid as a clinical drug for ischemic stroke.",

We describe two-month and two-year neurological outcomes in a prospective cohort.\nNeonates &#8805;36&#160;weeks' gestation with spontaneous hemorrhagic stroke (parenchymal and intraventricular) presenting at age &#8804;28&#160;days were enrolled between March 2007 and May 2015 at three tertiary pediatric centers. Hemorrhagic transformation of arterial ischemic stroke or cerebral sinovenous thrombosis was excluded. The Pediatric Stroke Outcome Measure (PSOM) assessed outcomes. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests evaluated change over time.\nTwenty-six neonates were included (median age: 1&#160;day, interquartile range [IQR] 0 to 16; median gestational age: 38.3&#160;weeks, IQR 37.0 to 39.0). Hemorrhage was isolated intraventricular in seven (27%), isolated intraparenchymal in six (23%), and a combination in 10 (39%). Three neonates (12%) died during hospitalization; one died later due to cardiac disease. Among 22 survivors, outcomes were assessed at a median of 2.1&#160;months (IQR 1.7 to 3.3) in 96% and 1.9&#160;years (IQR 1.3 to 2.0) in 73%. Median PSOM scores were 0.0 (IQR 0.0 to 1.0) and 0.25 (IQR 0.0 to 1.3), respectively. At two&#160;years, 45% of patients had no or nonimpairing deficits (PSOM <1.0), 30% had mild deficits (PSOM 1.0 to 2.0), and 5% had moderate deficits (PSOM 2.5 to 4.5). Over time, 31% worsened and 6% improved. Although total PSOM scores did not change significantly (P&#160;=&#160;0.08), language subscores worsened (P&#160;=&#160;0.009). No child developed epilepsy.\nPerinatal hemorrhagic stroke survivors had favorable outcomes in early childhood; at two&#160;years moderate to severe deficits occurred in 5%. Language deficits may emerge over time, warranting close follow-up.",

In an experimental prospective randomized cross-over study, 10 healthy adult&#160;donkeys were injected with saline solution, xylazine (0.20&#160;mg&#160;kg-1), and dexmedetomidine (0.005&#160;mg kg-1) into the epidural space between the second and third coccygeal vertebrae. Echocardiographic dimensions as well as cardiac function indices were assessed using a 2-3.9&#160;MHz sector transducer, at the left paracostal ultrasonographic window, at zero, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180&#160;minutes after administration of these medications. Epidural injection of xylazine or dexmedetomidine produced&#160;moderate sedation,&#160;complete bilateral perineal analgesia, and mild ataxia in all studied donkeys. There&#160;was a significant (P < .05) decrease in the interventricular septum thickness at end systole&#160;60&#160;minutes, stroke volume 30-120&#160;minutes, fractional shortening 120&#160;minutes, and ejection fraction 90-120&#160;minutes after administration of xylazine or dexmedetomidine when compared with saline solution. Left ventricular end diastolic volume was significantly (P < .05) increased 60&#160;minutes following epidural injection of dexmedetomidine compared with xylazine and saline solution. There was a significant (P < .05) increase in the left ventricular internal diameter at end diastole 90-120&#160;minutes and left ventricular end systolic volume 60-180&#160;minutes after administration of xylazine or dexmedetomidine in comparison with saline solution. In conclusion, epidural use of xylazine or dexmedetomidine in donkeys induced mild and transient effect on echocardiographic dimensions as well as cardiac function indices. Therefore, care should be taken when such medications are to be administered into the epidural space in donkeys with a pre-anesthetic cardiovascular compromise.",

        "title": "Lithium treatment mitigates white matter injury after intracerebral hemorrhage through brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling in mice.",
        "abstract": "\nIntracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), a subtype of stroke with high morbidity and mortality, occurs mainly in the basal ganglia and causes white matter injury (WMI), resulting in severe motor dysfunction and poor prognosis in patients. The preservation of the white matter around the hematoma is crucial for motor function recovery, but there is currently no effective treatment for WMI following ICH. Lithium has been widely used for the treatment of bipolar disorder for decades. Although the protective effects of lithium on neurodegenerative diseases and cerebral trauma have been studied in recent years, whether it can be used to alleviate WMI after ICH remains to be researched. The results of this study revealed that ICH caused significant functional and pathological abnormalities in mice. After LiCl was administered to mice with ICH, behavioural performance and electrophysiological functions were improved and ICH-induced white matter pathological injury, including myelin sheath and axonal degeneration, was ameliorated. Furthermore, LiCl treatment decreased the death of mature oligodendrocytes (OLGs) in ICH mice, which may have been attributed to the enhanced expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) regulated by the LiCl-induced inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3&#946; (GSK-3&#946;). The decreased death of OLGs was closely associated with decreased destruction of the myelin sheath and alleviated degradation of the axons. In summary, this study suggests that the protective effect of lithium on WMI after ICH might be related to an increased level of BDNF and that LiCl treatment may be a potential therapeutic method to palliate WMI after ICH.",

        "abstract": "\nCofilin-actin rods are covalently linked aggregates of cofilin-1 and actin. Under ischemic conditions, these rods have been observed in neuronal dendrites and axons and may contribute to the loss of these processes. Hypothermia (Hypo) and the 70 kD inducible heat shock protein (Hsp70) are both known to improve outcomes after stroke, but the mechanisms are uncertain. Here, we evaluated the effect of these factors on cofilin-actin rod formation in a mouse model of stroke.\nMice were subjected to distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) and treated with Hypo using a paradigm previously shown to be neuroprotective. We similarly studied mice that overexpressed transgenic (Tg) or were deficient knockout (Ko) in the inducible 70 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70), also previously shown to be protective by our group and others. Cofilin-actin rod formation was assessed by histological analysis at 4 and 24 h after dMCAO. Its expression was analyzed in three different regions, namely, infarct core (the center of the infarct), middle cerebral artery (MCA) borderzone (the edge of the brain regions supplied by the MCA), and the ischemic borderzone (border of ischemic lesion). Ischemic lesion size and neurological deficits were also assessed.\nBoth Hypo-treated and Hsp70 Tg mice had smaller lesion sizes and improved neurological outcomes, whereas Hsp70 Ko mice had larger lesion sizes and worsened neurological outcomes. Cofilin-actin rods were increased after stroke, but were reduced by therapeutic Hypo and in Hsp70 Tg mice. In contrast, cofilin-actin rods were increased in ischemic brains of Hsp70 Ko mice.\nCofilin-actin rod formation was suppressed under the conditions of neuroprotection and increased under circumstances where outcome was worsened. This suggests that cofilin-actin rods may act to participate in or exacerbate ischemic pathology and warrants further study as a potential therapeutic target.",

Despite high recanalization rates, up to half of the patients will not present a good neurological outcome after MT. Therapeutic hypothermia is perhaps the most robust neuroprotectant studied preclinically.\nWe explored various warming effects that can reduce the effectiveness or potency of selective hypothermia during AIS under conditions similar to actual clinical care. Four different selective hypothermia layouts were chosen. Layouts 1 and 2 used a single catheter without and with an insulated IV bag. Layouts 3 and 4 used two catheters arrange coaxially, without and with an insulated IV bag. Independent variables measured were IV bag exit temperature, catheter inlet temperature, and catheter outlet temperature at four different flow rates ranging from 8 to 25 ml/min over an infusion duration of 20 min.\nDominant warming occurs along the catheter pathway compared to warming along the infusion line pathway, ranging from 66% to 72%. Coaxial configurations provided an approximate 4&#176;C cooler temperature benefit on delivered infusate over a single catheter. Brain tissue temperature predictions show that the maximum cooling layout, Layout 4 at maximum flow provides a 1&#176;C within 5 min.\nSignificant rewarming effects occur along the infusate flow path from IV bag to site of injury in the brain. Previous selective hypothermia clinical work, using flow rates and equipment at conditions similar to our study, likely produced rapid but not deep tissue cooling in the brain (~ 1&#176;C).",

In this regard, intracarotid cooling is a very effective energetic approach, using the blood supply to the penumbra as a fast transport vector for heat exchange in affected brain regions. We review the state of development of a novel closed-loop cooling catheter, describing design-related as well as procedural aspects and presenting results from different theoretical and experimental studies.

Due to poor transferability of promising findings in rodent models to human clinical trials for neuroprotection, the focus of this review is large animal gyrencephalic models. Unlike rodent data which favor mild hypothermia, the majority of large animal studies on selective hypothermia support moderate-to-deep hypothermia (<30&#176;C).

        "abstract": "\nStroke accounts for a large proportion of global mortality and morbidity. Selective hypothermia, via intranasal cooling devices, is a promising intervention in acute ischemic stroke. However, prior to large clinical trials, preclinical studies in large animal models of ischemic stroke are needed to assess the efficacy, safety, and feasibility of intranasal cooling for selective hypothermia as a neuroprotective strategy. Here, we review the available scientific literature for evidence supporting selective hypothermia and make recommendations of a preclinical, large, animal-based, ischemic stroke model that has the greatest potential for evaluating intranasal cooling for selective hypothermia and neuroprotection. We conclude that among large animal models of focal ischemic stroke including pigs, sheep, dogs, and nonhuman primates (NHPs), cynomolgus macaques have nasal anatomy, nasal vasculature, neuroanatomy, and cerebrovasculature that are most similar to those of humans. Moreover, middle cerebral artery stroke in cynomolgus macaques produces functional and behavioral deficits that are quantifiable to a greater degree of precision and detail than those that can be revealed through available assessments for other large animals. These NHPs are also amenable to extensive neuroimaging studies as a means of monitoring stroke evolution and evaluating infarct size. Hence, we suggest that cynomolgus macaques are best suited to assess the safety and efficacy of intranasal selective hypothermia through an evaluation of hyperacute diffusion-weighted imaging and subsequent investigation of chronic functional recovery, prior to randomized clinical trials in humans.",

However, information on its possible protective effects against ischemic stroke is currently lacking. Here, using a mouse model of focal cerebral ischemia (fCI), we studied the protective potential of an oral supplement of PSL. Mice were randomly divided into four groups: SO, a group subjected to a sham-operation; VEH, pretreated with distilled water and subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R); PSL-L and PSL-H, pretreated with low (20 mg/kg) and high (100 mg/kg) doses of PSL, respectively, and subjected to the MCAO/R procedure. PSL was administered via an oral route daily for 8 days prior to surgery. We then measured the infarct volumes and sensorimotor deficits and studied the underlying antioxidant mechanisms by quantifying apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, oxidative damages, and antioxidant enzymes in the ischemic cortex. The results showed a marked attenuation in infarct volume and sensorimotor deficits in both the PSL-L and PSL-H groups when compared with VEH. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling and the immunohistochemical detection of the cleaved caspase-3 revealed that PSL could reduce cellular apoptosis in the ischemic lesion in a dose-dependent manner. The dihydroethidium-fluorescence, 4-hydroxynonenal, and 8-hydroxyl-2'-deoxyguanosine immunoreactivities in the ischemic lesion were markedly attenuated in the PSL-L group compared with the VEH group, indicating that PSL could attenuate ROS generation and the associated oxidative damage in the ischemic cortex. Finally, western blot results indicated that PSL can upregulate levels of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an antioxidant enzyme, in the lesion area. Together, these results suggest that PSL can exert protective effects against fCI, and the mechanism may involve HO-1 upregulation.",

Data of patients with HF were collected from their medical forms and recorded in a registry system of PROVE/HF plus telephone follow-up survey of 1, 6, and 12 months after the date of HF attack.\nAssessment of all related questions led to definition of a final questionnaire including 27 items regarding demographic information, underlying disorders and their complications, patients' symptoms and signs, and laboratory and relevant para-clinic data at admission time, during hospitalization, and post discharge. Follow-up information was mostly based on patients' general status and medication usage.\nPROVE execution was a successful and hopeful project providing data of major CVDs in order to design appropriate preventive actions and better management and treatment strategies plus a valuable data center being utilized in multiple future comprehensive projects.",

The mostly reported destructive lesions causing hypertrophic olivary degeneration are stroke, trauma, tumors, neurosurgical interventions, and gamma knife treatment of brainstem cavernoma. It presents with symptomatic palatal tremor, and typically appears as an expansive nonenhancing nodular lesion that shows increased signal intensity on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The identification of hypertrophic olivary degeneration on MRI is of great importance as its MRI appearance is very similar to those of more severe pathologies, including tumors, infarction, demyelinating lesions, and infections.

Patients with renal disease were more likely to have MACE after LE revascularization (5.2% vs. 2.5%; adjusted OR [aOR] 1.74, 95% CI 1.40-2.16), require LE amputation (26.1% vs. 12.2%; aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.19-1.50), and require hospital readmission within 6 months (61.0% vs. 43.6%; adjusted HR [aHR] 1.38, 95% CI 1.28-1.48) compared to those without renal disease.\nRenal disease is common among patients undergoing LE revascularization for PAD and was independently associated with in-hospital MACE, LE amputation, and hospital readmission within 6 months.

When needed, adding coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is the standard treatment method, but the impact of concomitant CABG on long-term outcomes is uncertain. We compared long-term outcomes of SAVR patients with and without CABG. Hospital survivors aged &#8805;50 years discharged after SAVR &#177; CABG in Finland between 2004 and 2014 (n&#8239;=&#8239;6,870) were retrospectively studied using nationwide registries. Propensity score matching (1:1) was used to identify patients with comparable baseline features (n&#8239;=&#8239;2,188 patient pairs, mean age 73 years). The end points were postoperative 10-year major adverse cardiovascular outcome (MACE), all-cause mortality, stroke, major bleeding, and myocardial infarction. Median follow-up was 6 years. Cumulative MACE rate (39.5% vs 35.6%; hazard ratio [HR] 1.04; p&#8239;=&#8239;0.677) and mortality (32.7% vs 31.0%; HR 1.03; p&#8239;=&#8239;0.729) after SAVR were comparable with or without CABG. Myocardial infarction was more common in patients with CABG (13.4% vs 6.9%; HR 1.47; p&#8239;=&#8239;0.0495). Occurrence of stroke (15.1% vs 13.5%; p&#8239;=&#8239;0.998) and major bleeding (20.0% vs 21.9%; p&#8239;=&#8239;0.569) were comparable.

The use of internal mammary artery in CABG did not have an impact on the results. In conclusion, matched patients with and without concomitant CABG had comparable long-term MACE, mortality, stroke, and major bleeding rates after SAVR. In conclusion, our results indicate that need for concomitant CABG has limited impact on long-term outcomes after initially successful SAVR.",

        "abstract": "\nInsulin resistance early after acute myocardial infarction is associated with increased heart failure and mortality. OMEGA-REMODEL was a prospective double-blind 1:1 randomized control trial of patients with AMI. We reported that 6-month treatment with omega-3 fatty acid (O-3FA) 4 g/day attenuated cardiac remodeling accompanied by reduction in inflammation. We hypothesized that insulin resistance modifies the therapeutic effect of O-3FA on post-MI cardiac remodeling. The OMEGA-REMODEL study group was dichotomized according to cohort- and gender-specific median cutoff value of leptin-to-adiponectin ratio (LAR) at baseline (LAR-Hi vs LAR-Lo). Mixed model regression analyses were used to evaluate effect modification of O-3FA on reduction of left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) by LAR status. Baseline LAR was evaluated on 325 patients (59 &#177; 11 years, 81% male). A total of 168 patients were categorized in LAR-Lo, and 157 in LAR-Hi. O-3FA treatment resulted in significant LVESVI reduction in patients with LAR-Lo but not with LAR-Hi (p&#8239;=&#8239;0.0002 vs 0.66, respectively). Mixed model regression analysis showed significant modification of LAR on O-3FA's treatment effect in attenuating LVESVI (p&#8239;=&#8239;0.021). In conclusion, this post-hoc efficacy analysis suggests that LAR status significantly modified O-3FA's treatment effect in attenuating cardiac remodeling. During the convalescent phase of acute infarct healing, patients with lower insulin resistance estimated by LAR appear to derive more therapeutic response from O-3FA toward improvement of LVESVI.",

For the early detection and prevention of heat-stroke, a wearable health monitor for in-ear use is developed which is subsequently called \"Hearable\". It aims to measure three vital parameters: Core body temperature, sweat rate and sweat or interstitial sodium ion (Na+) concentration. The eardrum is a good place to measure the core body temperature, because it is close to the carotid artery and the brain. We develop a hearable prototype and it consists of an audio earbud, a sensor earbud and a micro controller. Concerning the sensor earbud, a present prototype includes an eardrum (tympanic) temperature sensor and a sweat rate sensor and we implement two variants. Variant-1 focuses on the sweat rate sensing using a humidity & temperature sensor located close to the eardrum and Variant-2 focuses on the eardrum temperature sensing using an IR temperature sensor. Concerning the sweat rate sensing, unlike conventional sweat sensors, our prototypes do not include an air flow pump, which is typically used to determine the air flow rate. We demonstrate the accuracy of sweat rate sensing based on the air flow rate measured from the evaporation of defined amount of water. We use Variant-2 to demonstrate the monitoring of the eardrum temperature and the sweat rate to differentiate a calm state and jogging.",

Disturbed sleep is a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disorders such as arterial hypertension, cardiac ischemia, sudden cardiac death, and stroke. In this study we investigated polysomnographic records and analyzed the ECG, plethysmogram, respiration and SpO2 time series during wakefulness (WK), NREM, and REM sleep stages applying variability and coupling analyses methods. We enrolled 55 patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and 29 healthy control subjects (CON: 45.9&#177;14.9 years, 21 male) in this study. OSAS patients were subdivided into a low- and high-risk group (LR: 50.8&#177;14.1 years, n=29, 21 male; HR: 57.2&#177;13.4 years, n=26, 19 male) based on the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) (CON: 0-5 AHI, LR: 5-15 AHI, HR: >15 AHI). We could demonstrate the presence of an altered autonomic function in OSAS patients, differing from healthy controls. This altered autonomic function was mainly based on heart rate-, respiratory-, SpO2- and plethysmogram variability and their couplings. The discriminant analysis showed that the optimal set consisting of two autonomic indices revealed a high classification power (ACC=86.7%, AUC=90.3%, SENS=89.5% and SPEC=84.6%) when comparing low-risk and high-risk OSAS patients during WK. These results were slightly improved when analyzing REM sleep stages. Based on these results it seems to be possible to perform optimal risk stratification for OSAS patients based on autonomic indices. Based on our findings it is possible to differentiate between high-risk OSAS patient and low-risk OSAS patient at an early stage and in a promising manner allowing to set up therapy strategies for those patients in an early stage.",

To carry them out efficiently, various deep neural networks have been proposed recently as they provide much higher and reliable performance than the traditional image processing and manual segmentation methods. Non-invasive and robust quantification of salvageable tissue in acute ischemic stroke i.e., the ischemic penumbra, is critical for interventional stroke therapy. This paper proposes a Multi- Sequence Network (MSNet) architecture for this task. In this architecture, the information from multiple sequences are combined for identification and segmentation of core and penumbra (salvageable tissue) regions of ischemic stroke lesions and was tested on multisequence MRI ischemic lesion dataset of ISLES015. Performance of the proposed architecture, in terms of dice similarity coefficient, sensitivity and specificity are found to be 0.68, 0.805 and 0.99 respectively for the core of the lesion and 0.69, 0.949 and 0.964 respectively for the penumbra region.",

This study examined arm acceleration during front crawl swimming, and investigated how accelerometer-derived features change with lap times. Thirteen participants swam eight 50m laps using front crawl with a tri-axial accelerometer attached to each upper arm. Data were segmented into individual laps; lap times estimated and individual strokes extracted. Stroke times, root mean squared (RMS) acceleration, RMS jerk and spectral edge frequencies (SEF) were calculated for each stroke. Movement symmetry was assessed as the ratio of the minimum to maximum feature value for left and right arms. A regularized multivariate regression model was developed to estimate lap time using a subset of the accelerometer-derived features. Mean lap time was 56.99&#177;11.99s. Fifteen of the 42 derived features were significantly correlated with lap time. The regression model included 5 features (stroke count, mean SEF of the X and Z axes, stroke count symmetry, and the coefficient of variation of stroke time symmetry) and estimated 50m lap time with a correlation coefficient of 0.86, and a cross-validated RMS error of 6.38s.

These disorders are not only a functional handicap but also a social integration impairment. The recovery of facial mimics with a normal and symmetrical facial expression allows involved patients to improve their living conditions and social identity. Current approaches lack of visual feedbacks. To monitor facial mimics and head movements in a quantitative and objective manners, a computer-aided animation system needs to be developed. Numerous systems have been proposed using single camera, stereo camera, 3-D scanner, and Kinect approaches. In particular, Kinect contactless sensor has been proven to be very suitable for 3-D facial simulation applications. However, little studies have employed the Kinect sensor for real-time head animation applications. Consequently, this study developed a real-time head and facial mimic animation system using the contactless Kinect sensor and the system of systems approach. To evaluate the accuracy of the subject-specific Kinect-based geometrical models, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were used. As results, the mean distance deviation between generated Kinect-based and reconstructed MRI-based geometrical head models are approximately 1 mm for two tested subjects. The generation times are 9.7 s &#177; 0.3 and 0.046 s &#177; 0.005 by using the full facial landmarks and MPEG-4 facial landmarks respectively. Real-time head and facial mimic animations were illustrated. Particularly, the system could be executed at a very high framerate (60 fps).

        "abstract": "\nRecent research indicates that music-supported therapies may offer unique benefits for rehabilitation of motor function after stroke. We designed an adapted guitar and training task aimed to improve coordination between rhythmic and discrete movements because individuals recovering from stroke have greater difficulty performing discrete vs. rhythmic movements. In this paper, we report a feasibility study on training to play this adapted guitar in healthy young adults. Subjects (N = 10) practiced two rhythmic strumming patterns over three consecutive days using their non-dominant hand guided by an audiovisual metronome (60 bpm). They were also instructed to press a foot pedal while maintaining the strumming movement. Elbow and wrist kinematics were estimated using wireless inertial measurement units. Results showed positive mean asynchrony between strum onsets and metronome onsets, and a decrease in the standard deviation of mean asynchrony over practice. In early practice, participants slowed the strumming movement when they pressed the foot pedal, but this interference decreased on days two and three. Smoothness of the elbow movement during the strum phase, which includes the contact with the strings, increased over practice, while smoothness of the return phase did not change over practice. The predominant joint coordination pattern used for the strum phase consisted of elbow extension coupled with elbow pronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation. We discuss how these results fit into current music-based rehabilitation literature and outline directions for future applications of this music-supported intervention.",

        "title": "Designing Configurable Arm Rehabilitation Games: How Do Different Game Elements Affect User Motion Trajectories?",
        "abstract": "\nFor successful rehabilitation of a patient after a stroke or traumatic brain injury, it is crucial that rehabilitation activities are motivating, provide feedback and have a high rate of repetitions. Advancements in recent technologies provide solutions to address these aspects where needed. Additionally, through the use of gamification, we are able to increase the motivation for participants. However, many of these systems require complex set-ups, which can be a big challenge when conducting rehabilitation in a home-based setting. To address the lack of simple rehabilitation tools for arm function for a home-based application, we previously developed a system, Cellulo for rehabilitation, that is comprised of paper-supported tangible robots that are orchestrated by applications deployed on consumer tablets. These components enable different features that allow for gamification, easy setup, portability, and scalability. To support the configuration of game elements to patients' level of motor skills and strategies, their motor trajectories need to be classified. In this paper, we investigate the classification of different motor trajectories and how game elements impact these in unimpaired, healthy participants. We show that the manipulation of certain game elements do have an impact on motor trajectories, which might indicate that it is possible to adapt the arm remediation of patients by configuring game elements. These results provide a first step towards providing adaptive rehabilitation based upon patients' measured trajectories.",

While many clinical researchers have relied on time-series analysis of muscle activity, the frequency domain could offer additional insight on motor impairment. Our previous work has characterized movement capabilities in stroke survivors across endpoint and joint kinematic variables while performing a self-directed motor exploration task. Our solution to managing such large volumes of data is to create personalized statistical profiles using multivariate probability distributions. In this study, we present frequency domain analysis of EMG distributions for chronic post-stroke survivors (N = 6) and healthy subjects (N = 5) to identify between group differences in muscle activity. Comparing probability density of muscle activity magnitudes, differences from healthy were most evident at 275 Hz. Unique aspects of each patient's deficits were most evident at 125 Hz. This is the first study to explore distributions of EMG in specific frequency bands for this patient population. Such identifiability could pinpoint specific motor deficits and track progress in neurologically impaired individuals that often have widely differing disease states.",

In this study, we present a different method of eliciting the reflex response by imposing tendon indentation using a linear motor. Specifically, we test a \"Ramp-and-hold\" protocol, utilizing a linear motor controlled by a position-controlled feedback loop (Linmot, Inc), to indent the biceps brachii distal tendon at different velocities. The protocol was tested on the affected arm of three stroke subjects. We also utilized a tendon indentation combined with tendon-tapping method to quantify the reflex threshold. Our results indicate that the reflex response was elicited at velocities equal to or above 50 mm/s in 2/3 subjects. No reflex response was detected in one subject. All subjects showed a distinct reflex threshold using the indentation/tapping method. Furthermore, the presence of a reflex response during tendon-tapping was not necessarily accompanied by the elicitation of a reflex response during the ramp-and-hold. However, our data suggests that the indentation threshold during tapping is correlated to the presence of a reflex response at the velocities tested during the ramp-and-hold. Though more time consuming, tendon indentation using ramp-and-hold could provide greater resolution of the reflex response to quantify spasticity than the current clinically employed ballistic tapping method using a reflex hammer.",

In this work, we focus on reaching and grasping (R&G) movements in rats. Our objective is to develop an automatic algorithm to detect the onsets and offsets of muscle activity and use it to study muscle latencies in R&G maneuvers. We had a dataset of intramuscular EMG signals containing 51 R&G attempts from 2 different animals. Simultaneous video recordings were used for segmentation and comparison. We developed an automatic onset/offset detector based on the ratio of local maxima of Teager-Kaiser Energy (TKE). Then, we applied it to compute muscle latencies and other features related to the muscle activation pattern during R&G cycles. The automatic onsets that we found were consistent with visual inspection and video labels. Despite the variability between attempts and animals, the two rats shared a sequential pattern of muscle activations. Statistical tests confirmed the differences between the latencies of the studied muscles during R&G tasks. This work provides an automatic tool to detect EMG onsets and offsets and conducts a preliminary characterization of muscle activation during R&G movements in rats. This kind of approaches and data processing algorithms can facilitate the studies on upper limb motor control and motor impairment after spinal cord injury or stroke.",

        "title": "Heart Failure Phenotypes Require Sex-Specific Criteria Which Are Based on Ventricular Dimensions.",
        "abstract": "\nEjection fraction (EF) is often used as a criterion to establish diagnostic phenotypes of heart failure (HF). Because EF is a derived metric based on end-systolic volume (ESV) and end-diastolic volume (EDV), it is more logical to consider ESV or EDV as cut-off marker. We concentrate on the impact of ESV, which has the advantage of being linearly related to EDV and nonlinearly with EF, both with highly significant correlations. In particular we also analyze if HF classification should distinguish between females and males.ESV and EDV were determined by biplane angiography in 197 HF patients (67 women). As body surface indexed (i) ESVi values for adult healthy females are smaller than for males, we employ classes of ESVi (bins of 10 mL/m2) to group preserved and reduced EF's (cut-off at 50%) for HF. Reference values regarding mean and standard deviation for ESVi are based on a control group (N=155, 65 women) without HF. For interpretation of the findings we use the documented universal relationship connecting EF to ESV: EF = 1 + c1 {ESV / (c2 - ESV)}, where c1 and c2 are population-based sex-independent constants. In the reference group ESVi (mL/m2) in women (27.4 &#177; 27.6) is smaller (P=0.0026) than in their male counterparts (43.6 &#177; 37.5). Similarly, for HF the ESVi in women (45.7 &#177; 41.4) is smaller (P=0.0033) than in men (64.2 &#177; 41.4). This signifies (see formula above) that women have higher values for EF, primarily resulting from smaller ventricular size related to their sex, and not exclusively reflecting disease state. Current phenotype classification based on pooled data for males and females may be inappropriate for either sex.The significantly smaller ESVi observed in women has direct consequences for the traditional classification based on EF cutoff values for HF. Sex-specific criteria (regarding ESVi or EF) for HF phenotypes are warranted, and expectedly have substantial consequences for identification, classification, and management of HF patients.",

To allow for best possible device development, mock circulatory loops need to be able to simulate a variety of patient scenarios. Transition from rest to exercise is one of the most commonly simulated patient scenarios, however, to validate in vitro exercise test beds, baseline data on how the healthy heart and circulatory system responds to exercise is required. Steady state and time response data for heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) was continuously recorded using impedance cardiography in 50 healthy subjects (27 male / 23 female) during exercise on a recumbent exercise ergometer. This data was then used to implement an exercise simulation in a mock circulatory loop and both the steady state and transient results were compared with the mean response of subjects transitioning from rest to 60 W exercise. When transitioning from rest to exercise the time constant (&#964;) and rise time (tr) for HR, SV and CO were between 10.6-19.3s and 24.7-44.3s respectively for both sexes. No significant differences between the genders were found for &#964; and tr (p>0.05). Mock circulatory loop results of HR, SV and CO were in good accordance with human data. The present data was used to successfully validate in vitro exercise simulations and may be used to validate in silico numerical simulations of exercise, thus further improving the evaluation capabilities for existing and under development cardiac assist devices.",

        "abstract": "\nThe accurate assessment of upper limb motion impairment induced by stroke - which represents one of the primary causes of disability world-wide - is the first step to successfully monitor and guide patients' recovery. As of today, the majority of the procedures relies on clinical scales, which are mostly based on ordinal scaling, operator-dependent, and subject to floor and ceiling effects. In this work, we intend to overcome these limitations by proposing a novel approach to analytically evaluate the level of pathological movement coupling, based on the quantification of movement complexity. To this goal, we consider the variations of functional Principal Components applied to the reconstruction of joint angle trajectories of the upper limb during daily living task execution, and compared these variations between two conditions, i.e. the affected and non-affected arm. A Dissimilarity Index, which codifies the severity of the upper limb motor impairment with respect to the movement complexity of the non-affected arm, is then proposed. This methodology was validated as a proof of concept upon a set of four chronic stroke subjects with mild to moderate arm and hand impairments. As a first step, we evaluated whether the derived outcomes differentiate between the two conditions upon the whole data-set. Secondly, we exploited this concept to discern between different subjects and impairment levels. Results show that: i) differences in terms of movement variability between the affected and nonaffected upper limb are detectable and ii) different impairment profiles can be characterized for single subjects using the proposed approach. Although provisional, these results are very promising and suggest this approach as a basis ingredient for the definition of a novel, operator-independent, sensitive, intuitive and widely applicable scale for the evaluation of upper limb motion impairment.",

Understanding the correlation between parameters involved in joint movement mechanisms as well as force interactions could provide insight to establish an appropriate design for exoskeletons. Joints can be powered or even be rectified in terms of alignment by exoskeletons to help a patient recover quickly. For the study, OpenSIM 4.0 was used to generate models and simulations of the human musculoskeletal structure with and without introduced knee joint impairments along the sagittal and transverse directions. A scenario to simulate the constraints of an exoskeleton designed with a single hinge joint to mimic the knee joint was also considered. Alterations to the knee joint axis within the range of +5.00 to -6.40 mm would result in a meaningful yet not a significant change in muscle stresses; the simulation outputs indicate that constraining the knee joint motion to the sagittal plane will only increase the force generated by the vastus lateralis muscle up to 4.3%.",

        "abstract": "\nIn Western countries, stroke is the third-most widespread cause of death. 80% of all strokes are ischemic and show a mortality rate of about 25%. Furthermore, 35-55% of affected patients retain a permanent disability. Therapeutic hypothermia (TH) could decrease inflammatory processes and the stroke-induced cerebral damage. Currently, the standard technique to induce TH is cooling of the whole body, which can cause several side effects. A novel cooling sheath uses intra-carotid blood cooling to induce local TH. Unfortunately, the control of the temporal and spatial cerebral temperature course requires invasive temperature measurements. Computational modeling could be used to predict the resulting temperature courses instead. In this work, a detailed 1D hemodynamics model of the cerebral arterial system was coupled with an energetic temperature model. For physiological conditions, 50% and 100% M1-stenoses, the temperatures in the supply area of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and of the systemic body was analyzed. A 2K temperature decrease was reached within 10min of cooling for physiological conditions and 50% stenosis. For 100% stenosis, a significant lower cooling effect was observed, resulting in a maximum cerebral temperature decrease of 0.7K after 30min of cooling. A significant influence of collateral flow rates on the cooling effect was observed. However, regardless of the stenosis degree, the temperature decrease was strongest within the first 20min of cooling, which demonstrates the fast and effective impact of intra-carotid blood cooling.",

As a parameter for evaluation of signal quality, the percentage of current passing through the descending aorta from the overall injected current is measured. The placement according to Osypka results in 1.46 % of current flow through the descending aorta (Cheetah placement 1.12 %, Bernstein et al. placement 0.877 %) for the male human phantom DUKE. The simulation was compared with a real human subject (with comparable age, height, weight) by calculating the baseline impedance (Z0). The simulation seems to fit at best with Osypka placement, where the deviation between simulated baseline impedance and real human subject is 19.9 % (deviation for Cheetah 34.1 %, deviation for Bernstein 62.5 %). The simulation with MRI based human phantoms seems to be a very good basis for further investigations of current injection and bioimpedance measurement comprehension.",

        "abstract": "\nThe early detection of occult bleeding is a difficult problem for clinicians because physiological variables such as heart rate and blood pressure that are measured with standard patient monitoring equipment are insensitive to blood loss. In this study, the pulse arrival time (PAT) was investigated as an easily recorded, non-invasive indicator of hypovolemia. A lower body negative pressure (LBNP) study with a stepwise increase of negative pressure was conducted to induce central hypovolemia in a study population of 30 subjects. PAT values were extracted from simultaneous recordings of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmographic (PPG) recordings both from the index finger and from within the outer ear canal. Stroke volume (SV) was recorded as a reference measure by transthoracic echocardiography. An inter- and intra-individual correlation analysis between changes in SV and the PAT measurements was performed. Furthermore, it was assessed if PAT measurements can indicate a diminished SV in this scenario. It could be demonstrated that the measured PAT values are significantly increased at the lowest LBNP pressure level. A very strong intra-individual correlation (&#961; &#8805; 0.8) and a moderate inter-individual correlation (&#961; &#8805; 0.5) between PAT and SV measurements were found. Thus, PAT measurements could be a viable tool to monitor patient specific volemic trends. Further research is needed to investigate if PAT information can be utilized for a more robust inter-subject quantification of the degree of hypovolemia.",

        "abstract": "\nIschemic stroke is a major cause of disability among adults worldwide. Despite its prevalence, few effective treatment options exist to alleviate sensory and motor dysfunctions that result from stroke. In the past, rodent models of stroke have been the primary experimental models used to develop stroke therapies. However, positive results in these studies have failed to replicate in human clinical trials, highlighting the importance of nonhuman primate (NHP) models as a preclinical step. Although there are a few NHP models of stroke, the extent of tissue damage is highly variable and dependent on surgical skill. In this study, we employed the photothrombotic stroke model in NHPs to generate controlled, reproducible ischemic lesions. Originally developed in rodents, the photothrombotic technique consists of intravenous injection of a photosensitive dye such as Rose Bengal followed by illumination of an area of interest to induce endothelial damage resulting in the formation of thrombi in the illuminated vasculature. We developed a quantitative model to predict the extent of tissue damage based on the light scattering profile of light in the cortex of NHPs. We then employed this technique in the sensorimotor cortex of two adult male Rhesus Macaques. In vivo optical coherence tomography imaging of the cortical microvasculature and subsequent histology confirmed the formation of focal cortical infarcts and demonstrated its reproducibility and ability to control the sizes and locations of light-induced ischemic lesions in the cortex of NHPs. This model has the potential to enhance our understanding of perilesional neural dynamics and can be used to develop reliable neurorehabilitative therapeutic strategies to treat stroke.",

Currently, the clinical measurement of blood lactate is done by collecting intermittent blood samples. Therefore, noninvasive, optical measurement of this significant biomarker would lead to a big leap in healthcare. This study, presents a quantitative analysis of the optical properties of lactate. The benefits of wavelength selection for the development of accurate, robust, and interpretable predictive models have been highlighted in the literature. Additionally, there is an obvious, time- and cost-saving benefit to focusing on narrower segments of the electromagnetic spectrum in practical applications. To this end, a dataset consisting of 47 spectra of Na-lactate and Phosphate Buffer Solution (PBS) was produced using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, and subsequently, a comparative study of the application of a genetic algorithm-based wavelength selection and two interval selection methods was carried out. The high accuracy of predictions using the developed models underlines the potential for optical measurement of lactate. Moreover, an interesting finding is the emergence of local features in the proposed genetic algorithm, while, unlike the investigated interval selection methods, no explicit constraints on the locality of features was imposed. Finally, the proposed genetic algorithm suggests the formation of &#945;-hydroxy-esters methyl lactate in the solutions while the other investigated methods fail to indicate this.",

The developed phantom comprised of embedded silicone arteries (outer diameter = 4 mm) that were arranged parallel to one another at nine increasing depths (3.2 mm to 24.4 mm). A pulsatile pump (Harvard Apparatus, MA, USA) circulated a blood imitating fluid through the vessels at the desired heart rate (60 bpm) and stroke volume (5 Lmin-1). The PPG sensor's emitter and detector were isolated on a translation bridge to provide a computer-controlled separation distance between them. Recordings were taken at each vessel depth for emitter-detector separation distances from 2 mm to 8 mm in 0.1 mm steps. The optimum separation distance between the emitter and detector for vessels between depths of 3.2 mm and 10.5 mm was between 3.7 and 4.3 mm, suggesting that the maximum penetration of IR (930 nm) light in a homogenous pulsatile phantom is no greater than 10.5 mm.",

However, most systems require smartphones or tablet computers to acquire patient data due to BLE's short communication range. Instead of using smartphones, we installed around fifty BLE gateways to implement a hands-free data acquisition system. The system was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively. The data acquisition rate of the system was found to be over 90% through 24-hour patient monitoring, which is almost the same as that for systems using smartphones.

This study introduces adaptive learning methods in MRCP detection and aims at comparing a no-adaptive approach based on the Locality Sensitive Discriminant Analysis (LSDA) with three LSDA-based adaptive approaches. As a proof of concept, EEG and force data were collected from six healthy subjects while performing isometric ankle dorsiflexion. Results revealed that adaptive algorithms increase the number of true detections and decrease the number of false positives per minute.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is performed to localize the epileptogenic zone in the brain. However, the detection of epileptic spikes requires the visual assessment of long MEG recordings. This task is time-consuming and might lead to wrong decisions. Therefore, the introduction of effective machine learning algorithms for the quick and accurate epileptic spikes detection from MEG recordings would improve the clinical diagnosis of the disease. The efficiency of machine learning based algorithms requires a good characterization of the signal by extracting pertinent features. In this paper, we propose new sets of features for MEG signals. These features are based on a Semi-Classical Signal Analysis (SCSA) method, which allows a good characterization of peak shaped signals. Moreover, this method improves the spike detection accuracy and reduces the feature vector size. We could achieve up to 93.68% and 95.08% in average sensitivity and specificity, respectively.

Therefore, we conducted a screening experiment of six potential driving factors affecting the TVR response, with a D-optimal split plot fractional design matrix consisting of thirty-two combinations for each of the four participants with chronic hemiparetic stroke. Our results suggest that pre-vibration muscle activation level, vibration frequency, and stimulus application force, are all significant contributors to the TVR response in chronic hemiparetic stroke, along with an interaction between elbow flexion angle and muscle activity level.

In 2009, the Ministry of Health of China launched the China national stroke screening and intervention program, which screens stroke risk factors and conducts high-risk population interventions for people aged over 40 years old all over China. In this program, stroke risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, atrial fibrillation, smoking, lack of exercise, apparently overweight or obese and family history of stroke. People with more than two risk factors or with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) are considered as high-risk. However, it is impossible for this criterion to classify stroke risk level for people with \"unknown\" values in the fields of risk factors. The missing of stroke risk levels results in reduced efficiency of stroke interventions and inaccuracies in the statistical results at the national level. In this paper, firstly, we construct the training set and test set and process the imbalanced training set based on oversampling and undersampling method. Then, we develop logistic regression model, decision tree model, neural network model and random forest model for stroke risk classification, and evaluate these models based on the recall and precision. The results show that the model based on random forest achieves best performance considering recall and precision.

K-nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN) was used as the classifier to train the segmented data and classify the new data on each sample interval. To validate the proposed recognition method, three elite swimmers were recruited.

With only data of 5 stroke cycles for training, the recognizer produced accurate recognition results. The average precision across the phases and the subjects was 93.7% and the average recall was 92.6%. We also investigated the time difference of the key stroke events (stroke phase transitions) between the recognized decisions and the reference ones. The average time difference was 66.2 ms, which accounted for the 4.2% of a single stroke phase.

        "abstract": "\nIschaemic stroke is a medical condition caused by occlusion of blood supply to the brain tissue thus forming a lesion. A lesion is zoned into a core associated with irreversible necrosis typically located at the center of the lesion, while reversible hypoxic changes in the outer regions of the lesion are termed as the penumbra. Early estimation of core and penumbra in ischaemic stroke is crucial for timely intervention with thrombolytic therapy to reverse the damage and restore normalcy. Multisequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly employed for clinical diagnosis. However, a sequence singly has not been found to be sufficiently able to differentiate between core and penumbra, while a combination of sequences is required to determine the extent of the damage. The challenge, however, is that with an increase in the number of sequences, it cognitively taxes the clinician to discover symptomatic biomarkers in these images. In this paper, we present a data-driven fully automated method for estimation of core and penumbra in ischaemic lesions using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) sequence maps of MRI. The method employs recent developments in convolutional neural networks (CNN) for semantic segmentation in medical images. In the absence of availability of a large amount of labeled data, the CNN is trained using an adversarial approach employing cross-entropy as a segmentation loss along with losses aggregated from three discriminators of which two employ relativistic visual Turing test. This method is experimentally validated on the ISLES-2015 dataset through three-fold cross-validation to obtain with an average Dice score of 0.82 and 0.73 for segmentation of penumbra and core respectively.",

        "abstract": "\nPulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) is a progressive disorder which leads to heart failure and death. Development of dilated right ventricle (RV), progressive RV dysfunction and increased right atrial (RA) pressure make the RV transition from a compensated to a decompensated phase and eventually leads to heart failure. However, the relationship between elevated RA pressure and left ventricular contractility and ventricular arterial coupling (VAC) has not been well studied. 36 patients were recruited and underwent both right heart catheterization (RHC) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Left ventricular (LV) pressure-volume loops were reconstructed from RHC and CMR. LV contractility was assessed by end-systolic elastance (Ees) using single-beat method and arterial elastance (Ea) was estimated as the ratio of end-systolic pressure and stroke volume (SV). The VAC was calculated as the ratio of Ees and Ea (i.e. Ees/Ea). The results demonstrated a nonlinear relationship between RA pressure and Ees, RA pressure and VAC. Ees increased when RA pressure increased to 7 mmHg and then decreased when RA pressure exceeded 7 mmHg. Ees were 2.79 &#177; 1.61 mmHg/ml, 4.27 &#177;1 33 mmHg/ml, 2.69 &#177; 0.89 mmHg/ml and 2.36&#177; 1.10 mmHg/ml at ascending quartiles of RA pressure, respectively (quartile 1: RAP&#8804;5 mmHg; quartile 2: 5<; RAP&#8804;7 mmHg; quartile 3: 7<; RAP 10 mmHg and quartile 4: RAP>10 mmHg). Similarly, VAC were 1.36 &#177; 0.61, 1.93&#177;0.86, 1.16 &#177; 0.55 and 0.95&#177; 0.27 the four quartiles (both ANOVA P <; 0.05). We found that there was a nonlinear relationship between RA pressure and LV contractility, and between RA pressure and ventricular-arterial coupling. A cut-off value of 7 mmHg of RAP may indicate a decompensated LV hemodynamics.",

Electroporation ablation is emerging in cardiac ablation for atrial fibrillation as a fast, tissue-specific and non-thermal alternative to existing technologies tied by their thermal action to shortcomings in efficacy, speed and risk. Studies so far have aimed to translate the success of irreversible electroporation from tumour treatment, with its kilovolt pulses, to cardiac ablation. However, these high voltages may be less appealing for cardiac ablation from clinical, technical and regulatory standpoints. A novel ablation technique combining electroporation and electrolysis in a single pulse E2 uses lower voltages. A custom E2 ablation system was developed and tested on an in vivo tissue model. Histopathological analysis showed lesions of clinically relevant depth, achieved without any acute complications or severe muscle contractions. Lesions were mapped onto a numerical model developed to refine further prototyping.

This paper addresses the stability aspect by proposing a method to vary the endpoint stiffness using a variable impedance mechanism. The proposed device consists of permanent magnets in an antagonistic configuration that acts as springs and the variation in stiffness is achieved by modifying the separation between those magnets. This device is mounted on the end-effector of an admittance controlled robotic arm and tested with the help of healthy humans on a virtual maze traversal experiment consisting of both fine and gross motor regions. Moreover, the subjects are tested both in normal and simulated tremor conditions to verify the effectiveness of the device.

        "abstract": "\nSense of agency refers to the feeling of controlling one's own body. Many patients surviving from a stroke lose the sense of agency over their body. This is due to impairments in both motor control and sensory brain functions. As a result of this lack in the sense of agency, stroke patients tend to lose the intention of moving the paralyzed limb, which results in further deterioration of brain functions and worsening muscles and joints. The present study proposes a motor rehabilitation system using virtual reality to improve the sense of agency during upper-limb movement which is required for various daily life activities such as eating meals and operating devices. Specifically, participants were instructed to move their hand to track a moving target ball in a virtual reality environment, while the position of their real hand was measured via a motion capture system. Participants were shown another ball presenting the position of their hand in virtual reality. We tested the proposed system with healthy participants, of which the motor control was disturbed by a 1-kg weight attached on the wrist. Participants reported their sense of agency after each trial. The results showed that the sense of agency was enhanced by the proposed intervention. Our results pointed out a potentially useful method to improve the sense of agency during body movements using modified visual feedback, which may contribute to the development of rehabilitation for stroke patients.",

These markers may be multimodal and may include electrophysiological measures estimated from noninvasive, routinely collected clinical data, such as electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrocardiograms (ECG). In epilepsy, seizure detection and prediction from noninvasive data remains a difficult problem in need of novel approaches and markers. The inherent noise in high-dimensional EEG signals and artifact contamination often severely impacts the sensitivity and specificity of otherwise promising biomarkers. Long-term epilepsy clinical studies typically collect continuous ECG from which additional features may be estimated and combined with EEG measures to improve sensitivity to ictogenesis and seizure specificity. Prior work has focused on ventricular activity and features of the QRS complex, but atrial activity may also be modulated by seizure evolution. Given the high dimension of the ECG collected continuously over several days, an entirely data-driven approach is proposed, based on which ECG signals may be separated into ventricular and atrial contributions and studied separately. The relationship of atrial dynamics to seizure occurrence is assessed in a small number of pediatric epilepsy patients with high-dimensional ECG.",

MEDLINE (PubMed, Ovid), Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched on April 25, 2019, for relevant articles on cor triatriatum. After initial screening and removal of duplicates, 235 articles were selected. Data were extracted from these articles, including types, presentations, diagnostic findings, management, and outcomes of patients with cor triatriatum. Approximately 83% of patients with cor triatriatum had cor triatriatum sinistrum (CTS) and 17% had cor triatriatum dextrum (CTD). The mean age of all patients was 29&#177;23 years. Mean ages at diagnosis differed significantly in patients with CTS and CTD (31&#177;23 years vs. 21&#177;20 years, p=0.02). CTS showed a significantly greater association with AF (14.65% vs. 12.5%, p=0.036) and had a substantially higher risk of stroke (7.9% vs. 5.0%, p=0.04) than CTD. CTS also had a numerically higher association with atrial septal defects (15.13% vs. 15.6%), but this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.89). In contrast, cyanosis at presentation was significantly more frequent in patients with CTD than CTS (5.5% vs. 5.3%, p=0.05). Management did not differ significantly between these groups (p=0.29).

There is no specific surgical risk calculator for septal myectomy.\nThis study compares the outcomes of septal myectomy at a tertiary referral center with predicted outcomes of mitral valve (MV) repair and aortic valve replacement (AVR) using the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Risk Calculator (STS Calculator). A total of 298 consecutive patients with HCM underwent isolated septal myectomy from 2011 to 2014. Observed outcomes of septal myectomy were compared with the STS Calculator predicted risk of isolated MV repair and AVR predicted within this population using 1-sample tests of proportions.\nThirty-day mortality for myectomy in this cohort was zero. STS Calculator predicted risk of mortality for MV repair was 0.7% (P&#8239;=&#8239;.14) and for AVR&#8239;=&#8239;1.1% (P&#8239;=&#8239;.06). Follow-up for vital status was 6.0&#8239;&#177;&#8239;0.7 years, at which 294 (98.7%) patients were alive. Hospital stay length was 4.9&#8239;&#177;&#8239;1.9 days. One (0.3%) patient experienced a postoperative deep sternal wound infection, and 1 (0.3%) patient experienced a prolonged ventilated state. Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurred in 64 (21.5%) patients. During 30 days of follow-up, no patients experienced stroke, renal failure, or needed dialysis.\nSeptal myectomy, performed in a tertiary referral center, had a 30-day mortality rate of 0% and low morbidity rate. There was no difference between observed myectomy mortality and STS Calculator predicted risk for AVR and MV repair. It is possible that a larger sample could reveal lower mortality than STS prediction.",

        "abstract": "\nPrevious studies have shown that metformin not only is a hypoglycemic agent but also has neuroprotective effects. However, the mechanism of action of metformin in ischemic stroke is unclear. Oxidative stress is an important factor in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. It has been reported that metformin is associated with stroke risk in the clinical population. This study is aimed at investigating the effect and mechanism of metformin in an experimental model of oxidative stress induced by ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in vivo and oxygen glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) in vitro. Metformin (100, 200, and 300&#8201;mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally immediately after induction of cerebral ischemia. The indicators of oxidative stress selected were antioxidant enzyme activities of catalase, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidation enzyme (GSHPx). First, we demonstrated that metformin can significantly alleviate acute and chronic cerebral I/R injury and it has a strong regulatory effect on stroke-induced oxidative stress. It can reduce the elevated activities of MDA and NO and increase the levels of GSHPx and SOD in the cerebrum of mice and N2a cells exposed to I/R. Furthermore, real-time PCR and western blot were used to detect the expression of long noncoding RNA H19 (lncRNA-H19), microRNA-148a-3p (miR-148a-3p), and Rho-associated protein kinase 2 (Rock2). The direct interaction of lncRNA-H19, miR-148a-3p, and Rock2 was tested using a dual luciferase reporter assay. lncRNA-H19 altered OGD/R-induced oxidative stress by modulating miR-148a-3p to increase Rock2 expression. The expression of lncRNA-H19 and Rock2 could be downregulated with metformin in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, our study confirmed that metformin exerts neuroprotective effects by regulating ischemic stroke-induced oxidative stress injury via the lncRNA-H19/miR-148a-3p/Rock2 axis. These results provide new evidence that metformin may represent a potential treatment for stroke-related brain injury.",

Therefore, understanding the expression and pathogenic modifications of AS is clinically meaningful for evaluating the prognosis of stroke. Here, 54 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and 55 controls were enrolled. Different forms of AS in red blood cells (RBCs), including hemoglobin-bound AS (Hb-AS), oligomeric AS (O-AS), and serine 129-phosphorylated AS (pS-AS), were measured using ELISA methods. Compared with controls, significantly increased levels of Hb-AS, O-AS, and pS-AS were observed in AIS patients. The levels of O-AS and pS-AS were both positively correlated with that of Hb-AS. However, no correlation was observed between O-AS and pS-AS. The levels of all three forms of AS were associated with increased risk of AIS diagnosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves revealed that the three forms of AS yielded a moderate discriminative power (AUC ranging from 0.67 to 0.71 in discriminating AIS patients from controls, with varying sensitivity (0.41~0.61), specificity (0.78~0.90), PPV (0.73~0.81), and NPV (0.61~0.68)).

We investigated the association between calcification in carotid plaque and stroke by analyzing the different characteristics of calcification and neovascularization distribution in heterogeneous plaques by both two-dimensional and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS).\nA total of 69 patients who were about to undergo carotid endarterectomy were selected between January 2016 and December 2017. Thirty-eight patients with cerebral ischemia were placed in the symptomatic group (amaurosis, TIA and no disability in the previous 6 months), and the other 31 patients, who were asymptomatic, were placed in the asymptomatic group. Two-dimensional ultrasound and CEUS were used to detect the calcification distribution characteristics and neovascularization in the plaques of all subjects. The differences of the calcification location, shape, quantity, and enhancement in the plaques were compared between the two groups.\nThere was no significant difference in calcification location between the two groups (P > 0.05). The symptomatic group had more nodular calcification but less strip calcification compared with the asymptomatic group (both P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in mixed morphologic calcification between the two groups (P > 0.05). The symptomatic group had a higher calcification quantity (P < 0.05).

Parameters of hemodynamics and rSO2 were obtained at seven time points including before induction of anesthesia (T1), 5 min after trachea cannula (T2), 5, 60, and 120 min after pneumoperitoneum in the Trendeleburg position (T3, T4 and T5, respectively), after desufflation in the Trendeleburg position (T6), and at the end of the operation in a supine position (T7). The postoperative outcomes were recorded.\nCompared to C group, intraoperatively, patients in the G group received more colloid (P<0.05). The stroke volume variation in G group at T5, T6 and T7 was significantly lower than that in C group (P<0.05). The cardiac index, forearm and crural rSO2 in G group at T4, T5, T6 and T7 were significantly higher than those in C group (P<0.05). No significant differences were observed for the cerebral rSO2 between the two groups (P > 0.05). The postoperative hospital stay and complications also showed no differences between these two groups.\nAlthough the implementation of GDFT cannot increase cerebral rSO2, the forearm and crural rSO2 are improved during the laparoscopic colorectal surgery, which is helpful to reduce the risk of regional tissue hypoxia.",

We present a unique case of an anterior ST elevation myocardial infarction as a result of coronary embolism, the source of which appears to be calcific debris from mitral annular calcification (MAC). Although embolic phenomena in the setting of MAC has been documented previously, particularly in the setting of acute ischemic stroke, to our knowledge this is the first reported case in the literature where MAC alone appears to have resulted in a coronary embolic event. <Learning objective: Myocardial infarction as the result of embolic coronary phenomena is uncommon. Thrombotic emboli in the setting of atrial fibrillation, paradoxical emboli in the setting of structural heart defects, and cardiac masses are among the most common causes of coronary embolism. We make the argument that debris from mitral annular calcification may also serve as an uncommon mechanism of embolic phenomena.>.",

Better tailored DAPT strategies are needed to address this medical need.\nTo assess the cost-effectiveness of guided DAPT with clopidogrel or ticagrelor in addition to aspirin when using VerifyNow P2Y12 testing in post-ACS patients.\nThe costs were calculated per 1,000 patients aged >55 years. It was assumed that all patients received either generic clopidogrel or ticagrelor for 1 year, and underwent VerifyNow P2Y12 assay testing before DAPT maintenance.\nGuided DAPT will prevent five more MIs and six more deaths per 1,000 patients than a standard prescription of generic clopidogrel. The total predictive value of costs per patient is 32% lower if a guided strategy is used than if ticagrelor is given to all patients.\nAssessment of heightened residual platelet reactivity with P2Y12 assay in triaging DAPT post-ACS patients for 1 year is a cost-effective strategy that would reduce financial burden compared to routine administration of more expensive antiplatelet agents.",

Chronic total occlusions (CTOs) represent the \"last frontier\" of percutaneous interventions. While open strategies are considered earlier as standard management for these lesions, the results of a number of trials indicate that endovascular management might become an effective alternative to surgery.\nThis paper presents 5-year outcomes of a first-in-man (FIM) study (before CE mark) and the registry of OCT Guided Ocelot Catheter (Avinger) for chronic total occlusions of the superficial femoral artery. The study group comprised 10 patients with Rutherford 3 lower limb ischemia including nine men and one woman.\nThe efficacy of the primary intervention was 90%. Angiography performed at 6 months of the procedure, according to the study protocol, revealed 3 and 1 cases of restenosis and reocclusion, respectively, repaired using PTA and open common and deep femoral artery patch plasty. Doppler ultrasound performed at 1, 2 and 5 years after the primary intervention did not reveal significant target vessel restenosis. The primary and primary-assisted patency was 89%. During a 5-year follow-up, four peripheral percutaneous interventions and one femoropopliteal bypass surgery were performed in non-target limbs. There were no cardiovascular deaths, myocardial infarction or stroke and no amputation was required.\nThis is a first-in-man study reporting long-term follow-up after SFA CTO revascularization using the Ocelot catheter. The catheter proved to have a satisfactory safety profile and a high proportion of CTO crossings. A 5-year follow-up revealed high primary and primary-assisted patency rates.",

        "abstract": "\nCell therapy has emerged as a promising strategy for treating neurological diseases such as stroke, spinal cord injury, and various neurodegenerative diseases, but both embryonic neural stem cells and human induced Pluripotent Stem Cell- (iPSC-) derived neural stem cells have major limitations which restrict their broad use in these diseases. We want to find a one-step induction method to transdifferentiate the more easily accessible Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (UC-MSCs) into neural stem/progenitor cells suitable for cell therapy purposes. In this study, UC-MSCs were induced to form neurospheres under a serum-free suspension culture with Epidermal Growth Factor- (EGF-) and basic Fibroblast Growth Factor- (bFGF-) containing medium within 12 hours. These MSC-derived neurospheres can self-renew to form secondary neurospheres and can be readily induced to become neurons and glial cells. Real-time PCR showed significantly upregulated expression of multiple stemness and neurogenic genes after induction. RNA transcriptional profiling study showed that UC-MSC-derived neurospheres had a unique transcriptional profile of their own, with features of both UC-MSCs and neural stem cells. RayBio human growth factor cytokine array analysis showed significantly upregulated expression levels of multiple neurogenic and angiogenic growth factors, skewing toward a neural stem cell phenotype. Thus, we believe that these UC-MSC-derived neurospheres have amenable features of both MSCs and neural stem/progenitor cells and have great potential in future stem cell transplantation clinical trials targeting neurological disorders.",

        "abstract": "\nErythrocytapheresis, red blood cell (RBC) depletion, and RBC exchange transfusions are apheresis techniques used to rapidly lower the circulating RBC mass or to exchange the patient erythrocyte mass with donor RBC. Automated RBC exchange is performed using an apheresis device, while manual RBC exchange is based on sequential phlebotomies and isovolemic replacement. Compared to simple RBC transfusions, RBC exchange offers several advantages, e.g., a lower risk for iron accumulation and efficient control of pathological erythrocyte populations. Disadvantages are the higher costs of the procedure, the increased use of donor RBC, and the requirement of apheresis devices and trained hospital staff. The most frequent indication for RBC exchange is sickle cell disease (SCD). RBC exchange transfusions are standard treatment in SCD patients with a history of or a risk for acute stroke and are clinical options for other acute complications of SCD. The most common indication for RBC depletion is the removal of donor RBC from the bone marrow grafts in major ABO-incompatible allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to avoid immediate hemolysis. Rare indications for RBC exchange are severe infections with intraerythrocytic pathogens such as malaria or babesiosis and severe erythrocytosis or hereditary hemochromatosis where the aim is to rapidly decrease RBC populations or the iron content. However, only few high-quality studies are available looking at the efficacy of RBC exchange in the different disease entities, and treatment is often based on low levels of evidence and should therefore be decided in close collaboration with a transfusion medicine specialist.",

Hospital, ambulatory and mixed data sources were assessed in 10, 4 and 10 studies, respectively. Nine different AF case definitions were evaluated, most based on ICD-9 or 10 codes. Twenty-two studies assessed case definitions in patients diagnosed with AF and thus could generate PPV alone. Half the studies sampled unrestricted populations including a mix of those with and without AF to assess sensitivity. Only 13 studies included ECG confirmation as a gold standard. The pooled random effects estimates were: sensitivity 80% (95% CI 72-86%); specificity 98% (96-99%); PPV 88% (82-94%); NPV 97% (94-99%). Only 3 studies reported all accuracy parameters and included rhythm monitoring in the gold standard definition.\nRelatively few studies examined sensitivity, and fewer still included rhythm monitoring in the gold standard comparison.

According to the etiologies, patients were divided into thrombotic IJVS and non-thrombotic IJVS groups. And further, non-thrombotic IJVS group was divided into external compression and non-external compression subgroups. Outcomes of IJVS with different etiologies and strategies were compared and the probable prognostic factors were analyzed.\nA total of 118 eligible patients enrolled in this study, including 76 females and 42 males, mean aged 55.07&#177;14.61 years. The average follow-up duration after discharge was 13.22&#177;3.80 months. According to the PGIC scores, we categorized patients as good outcome and poor outcome groups. For thrombotic IJVS, patients underwent standard anticoagulant obtained remarkable PGIC improvement (100.0% vs. 33.3%, P=0.038). For non-thrombotic IJVS, stenting showed benefit in non-external compression subgroup (26.9% vs. 3.3%, P=0.019) but not in external compression subgroup. In addition, we found that in this Chinese IJVS cohort, poor outcomes involved old age (P=0.004), type 2 diabetes mellitus (P=0.036), previous hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (P=0.027), and head noises (P=0.002). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that continuous head noises [P=0.045, odds ratio (OR): 2.412, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.019-5.711], as a unique symptom of IJVS may be significantly related to poor outcomes.\nIn this Chinese cohort, elderly degenerative bone compression, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and previous HBV infection are the top-three probable etiologies of non-thrombotic IJVS and may involve poor outcome. Long-term head noises may predict IJVS and with poor outcome. Thrombosis-induced IJVS may get benefit from standard anticoagulation. Non-external compression IJVS can be corrected by stenting.",

        "abstract": "\nThe patient's perspective is becoming increasingly important in clinical and policy decisions. This study examined atrial fibrillation (AF) patient preferences for different characteristics of nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs).\nA discrete choice experiment (DCE) addressing AF patients treated with NOACs in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom was conducted. The DCE included the following attributes: frequency of administration (once/twice daily), size of tablet/capsule (6-9&#8201;mm/20&#8201;mm), meal-related intake (intake with food required/independent), and distance to treating physician (1&#8201;km/10&#8201;km). Preferences were analyzed based on a conditional logit regression model.\nIn total, 758 patients (males: 57.3%; mean age: 71.4 years) with an average disease duration of 5.5 years were included (apixaban/dabigatran/edoxaban/rivaroxaban: 34.0%/14.5%/6.6%/44.9%, respectively). Patients preferred NOAC treatment options characterized by once-daily dosing regimens (42.8%; p < 0.001), shorter distance to treating physicians (25.0%; p < 0.001), a small-sized tablet (21.5%; p < 0.001), and intake independent of food (10.6%; p < 0.001).\nPatients primarily prefer a once-daily NOAC regimen. Individual preferences should be considered for the treatment of AF patients as this may result in improved treatment adherence and consequently better effectiveness and safety in routine clinical practice.",

Exoskeleton designs benefit from low impedance and accurate torque control. We designed a 2 degree-of-freedom tethered exoskeleton that can provide independent torque control on elbow flexion/extension and forearm supination/pronation. Two identical series elastic actuators (SEAs) are used to actuate the exoskeleton. The two SEAs are coupled through a novel cable-driven differential. The exoskeleton is compact and lightweight, with a mass of 0.9 kg. Applied RMS torque errors were less than 0.19 Nm. Benchtop tests demonstrated a torque rise time of approximately 0.1 s, a torque control bandwidth of 3.7 Hz and an impedance of less than 0.03 Nm/deg at 1 Hz. The controller can simulate a stable maximum wall stiffness of 0.45 Nm/deg. The overall performance is adequate for robotic therapy applications and the novelty of the design is discussed.",

This Cochrane systematic review assessed the impact of this intervention on mortality and cardiovascular events. Eighty-eight randomized controlled trials with 19 161 participants were included (53 trials on cardiac surgery and 35 trials on non-cardiac surgery). In cardiac surgery perioperative beta-blockers had a protective effect against supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias but had no significant effect on mortality or on the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, heart failure, hypotension or bradycardia. In non-cardiac surgery, beta-blockers had a protective effect against AMI and arrhythmias, but this was counterbalanced by an increased risk of death and stroke. In conclusion, perioperative use of beta-blockers appears overall to be bene&#64257;cial in cardiac surgery. However, in non-cardiac surgery the substantial reduction in rhythm disturbances and AMI appears to be offset by an increase in mortality and stroke, and so the systematic use of beta-blockers in this setting is not recommended.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground and Purpose- Computed tomography (CT) perfusion (CTP) provides potentially valuable information to guide treatment decisions in acute stroke. Assessment of interobserver reliability of CTP has, however, been limited to small, mostly single center studies. We performed a large, internet-based study to assess observer reliability of CTP interpretation in acute stroke. Methods- We selected 24 cases from the IST-3 (Third International Stroke Trial), ATTEST (Alteplase Versus Tenecteplase for Thrombolysis After Ischaemic Stroke), and POSH (Post Stroke Hyperglycaemia) studies to illustrate various perfusion abnormalities. For each case, observers were presented with noncontrast CT, maps of cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow, mean transit time, delay time, and thresholded penumbra maps (dichotomized into penumbra and core), together with a short clinical vignette. Observers used a structured questionnaire to record presence of perfusion deficit, its extent compared with ischemic changes on noncontrast CT, and an Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score for noncontrast CT and CTP. All images were viewed, and responses were collected online. We assessed observer agreement with Krippendorff-&#945;. Intraobserver agreement was assessed by inviting observers who reviewed all scans for a repeat review of 6 scans. Results- Fifty seven observers contributed to the study, with 27 observers reviewing all 24 scans and 17 observers contributing repeat readings. Interobserver agreement was good to excellent for all CTP. Agreement was higher for perfusion maps compared with noncontrast CT and was higher for mean transit time, delay time, and penumbra map (Krippendorff-&#945; =0.77, 0.79, and 0.81, respectively) compared with cerebral blood volume and cerebral blood flow (Krippendorff-&#945; =0.69 and 0.62, respectively). Intraobserver agreement was fair to substantial in the majority of readers (Krippendorff-&#945; ranged from 0.29 to 0.80). Conclusions- There are high levels of interobserver and intraobserver agreement for the interpretation of CTP in acute stroke, particularly of mean transit time, delay time, and penumbra maps.",

        "abstract": "\nCognitive deficits are important predictors for outcome, independence and quality of life after stroke, but often remain unnoticed and unattended because other impairments are more evident. Computerized cognitive training (CCT) is among the candidate interventions that may alleviate cognitive difficulties, but the evidence supporting its feasibility and effectiveness is scarce, partly due to the lack of tools for outcome prediction and monitoring. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides candidate markers for disease monitoring and outcome prediction. By integrating information not only about lesion extent and localization, but also regarding the integrity of the unaffected parts of the brain, advanced MRI provides relevant information for developing better prediction models in order to tailor cognitive intervention for patients, especially in a chronic phase. Using brain age prediction based on MRI based brain morphometry and machine learning, we tested the hypotheses that stroke patients with a younger-appearing brain relative to their chronological age perform better on cognitive tests and benefit more from cognitive training compared to patients with an older-appearing brain. In this randomized double-blind study, 54 patients who suffered mild stroke (>6 months since hospital admission, NIHSS&#8804;7 at hospital discharge) underwent 3-weeks CCT and MRI before and after the intervention. In addition, patients were randomized to one of two groups receiving either active or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). We tested for main effects of brain age gap (estimated age - chronological age) on cognitive performance, and associations between brain age gap and task improvement. Finally, we tested if longitudinal changes in brain age gap during the intervention were sensitive to treatment response. Briefly, our results suggest that longitudinal brain age prediction based on automated brain morphometry is feasible and reliable in stroke patients. However, no significant association between brain age and both performance and response to cognitive training were found.",

        "abstract": "\nTo investigate the effect of variable tricuspid annular reduction (TAR) on functional tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) and right ventricular (RV) dynamics in ovine tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.\nNine adult sheep underwent implantation of a pacemaker with an epicardial lead and were paced at 200 to 240 bpm until the development of biventricular dysfunction and functional TR was noted. During reoperation on cardiopulmonary bypass, 6 sonomicrometry crystals were placed around the tricuspid annulus (TA) and 14 were placed on the RV epicardium. Annuloplasty suture was placed around the TA and externalized to an epicardial tourniquet. After weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and sonomicrometry data were acquired at baseline and during 5 progressive TARs achieved with suture cinching. TA area and RV free wall strains and function were calculated from crystal coordinates.\nAfter pacing, changes in left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and RV fractional area decreased significantly. Mean TA diameter increased from 25.1&#160;&#177;&#160;2.9&#160;mm to 31.5&#160;&#177;&#160;3.3&#8201;mm&#160;(P&#160;=&#160;.005), and median TR (range, 0-3+) increased from 0 (0) to 3 (2) (P&#160;=&#160;.004). Progressive suture cinching reduced the TA area by 18&#160;&#177;&#160;6%, 38&#160;&#177;&#160;11%, 56&#160;&#177;&#160;10%, 67&#160;&#177;&#160;9%, and 76&#160;&#177;&#160;8%. Only aggressive annular reductions (67% and 76%) decreased TR significantly, but these were associated with deterioration of RV function and strain. A moderate annular reduction of 56% led to a substantial reduction of TR with little deleterious effect on regional RV function.\nA moderate TAR of approximately 50% may be most advantageous for correction of functional TR and simultaneous maintenance of regional RV performance. Additional subvalvular interventions may be needed to achieve complete valvular competence.",

Little is known about this approach for craniotomy.\nThis observational study involved sequential implementation of a multidisciplinary team, protocols, and a craniotomy pathway. Data on 3693 admissions were retrospectively reviewed at a tertiary care neurosurgery center from 2008 to 2017 for the top 6 diagnosis-related group codes. In June 2016, a searchable discharge summary template in the electronic medical record was implemented to capture data regarding quality, efficiency, and outcomes.\nStaffing transitioned to a team of neurosurgeons, neurointensivists, neurohospitalists, and midlevel practitioners. Order sets, protocols, and pathways were developed. Quality improvements were observed for craniotomy and cranioplasty surgical site infections, ventriculitis, coagulopathy reversal, and decompressive hemicraniectomy rates for stroke. Case volume increased 73%, yet craniotomy hospital days decreased from 2768 in 2008 to 2599 in 2017 because of reduced length of stay. We accommodated service line growth without hospital expansion or case backlogs. With an average California hospital day rate of $3341, the improved length of stay decreased costs by $14,666,990/y. We also present outcomes data, including craniotomy indications, operative timing, complications, functional outcomes, delays in discharge, and discharge destinations using the craniotomy discharge summary.\nMultidisciplinary teams, protocols, and pathways reduced craniotomy complication rates, improved hospital length of stay by 63%, reduced costs, and increased professional collegiality and satisfaction. A searchable craniotomy discharge summary is an important tool for continuous monitoring of quality and efficiency of care.",

Here we constructed an experimental system to evaluate how the properties of neutrophils were influenced by the injured brain tissues. HL60 cells differentiated into neutrophils were added to the culture medium of neonatal rat cortico-striatal slices maintained at liquid-air interface. Thrombin was applied to the cultures to mimic the pathogenic events associated with ICH. HL60 cells responded to thrombin by increasing mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory IL-1&#946; and anti-inflammatory IL-10 with a different time course. Co-presence of cortico-striatal slice cultures significantly enhanced IL-1&#946; mRNA expression, whereas attenuated IL-10 mRNA expression, in HL60&#160;cells. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonist lipopolysaccharide synergistically enhanced IL-1&#946; mRNA expression with thrombin, and TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242 abolished thrombin-induced IL-1&#946; mRNA expression in the presence of slice cultures. On the other hand, thrombin-induced cell death in cortico-striatal cultures was attenuated by the presence of HL60&#160;cells.

Several circulating long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are reportedly involved in the chronic pathological process of cardiac function and remodeling in cardiovascular diseases. However, the potential roles of these circulating lncRNAs as biomarkers of cardiac function and remodeling during early-stage AMI remain unclear.\nFifty-three patients with AMI and 90 controls without AMI were consecutively enrolled in this study. Clinical parameters and blood samples at different time points (i.e., 24&#160;h and 3&#160;days) were collected.\nCompared with the controls, the circulating levels of cardiac hypertrophy-associated transcript (CHAST) significantly increased in AMI patients, and the CHAST levels obviously decreased at 3&#160;days. In AMI patients, the expression levels of CHAST at 24&#160;h were positively associated with cardiac contractile function and measured as left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular short-axis shortening rate (all P&#160;<&#160;0.050). Multivariate regression analysis indicated that the expression level of CHAST at 24&#160;h was an independent predictor of cardiac contractile function (standardized &#946;&#160;=&#160;0.319, P&#160;=0.034). When grouped according to the quartile values of the CHAST in the AMI population, patients with the highest quartiles of CHAST expression level showed better cardiac contractile function than all the other quartiles (all P&#160;<&#160;0.050).\nCHAST was an independent predictor of cardiac contractile function at early-stage AMI and may serve as a candidate biomarker for cardiac remodeling.",

In this prespecified analysis, risks of first major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding event and composite end point of death, thromboembolic events, or unplanned revascularization were compared between dabigatran dual therapy and warfarin triple therapy in older (&#8805; 75 years) and younger (< 75 years) patients, using Cox proportional hazard regression. Of 2,725 patients randomized to treatment, 1,026 (37.7%) were categorized into older and 1,699 (62.3%) into younger age groups. Dabigatran 110 mg dual therapy lowered bleeding risk versus warfarin triple therapy in older (hazard ratio [HR] 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.51 to 0.89) and younger patients (HR 0.40; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.54); interaction p value: 0.0125. Dabigatran 150 mg dual therapy lowered bleeding risk versus warfarin triple therapy in younger patients (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.74), whereas no benefit could be observed in older patients (HR 1.21; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.77); interaction p value: 0.0013. For the thromboembolic end point, there was a trend for a higher risk with dabigatran 110 mg dual therapy in older patients, compared with warfarin triple therapy, whereas the risk was similar in younger patients. For dabigatran 150 mg dual therapy, the thromboembolic risk versus warfarin triple therapy was similar in older and younger patients.

To determine the incidence and predictors of AKR between surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and TAVR, we examined patients with chronic kidney disease and severe aortic stenosis who underwent SAVR or TAVR procedure between 2007 and 2017; excluding age <65 or >90, dialysis, endocarditis, non-aortic valve stenosis, or patients died within 48-hours postprocedure. AKR was defined as an increase of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >25% and AKI as decrease in eGFR >25% at discharge. Stroke, mortality, major bleeding, transfusion, and length of stay were examined. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to examine predictors of AKR. There were 750 transcatheter and 1,062 surgical patients and 319 pairs after propensity matching. AKR was observed in 26% TAVR versus 23.2% SAVR, p&#8239;=&#8239;0.062. Highest recovery was in patients with eGFR <30 for both TAVR (33.7%) and SAVR (34.5%) patients. Independent predictors of AKR were ejection fraction <50% (odds ratio [OR] 1.66, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02 to 2.71, p&#8239;=&#8239;0.042), female gender (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.5, p&#8239;=&#8239;0.015), and obesity (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.04-2.3, p&#8239;=&#8239;0.032). Diabetes was a negative predictor of AKR (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.84, p&#8239;=&#8239;0.005). AKR was associated with improved secondary clinical outcomes compared with AKI. In conclusion, AKR is a generalizable phenomenon occurring frequently and similarly among transcatheter or surgical aortic valve patients.

HQMS was developed by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Demographics, outcomes at discharge, and financial information were extracted automatically from the medical records.\nWe identified 29,031 cases with SE as the primary diagnosis from 585 tertiary centres during the five-year period.

The in-hospital mortality rate was 1.46 % over the whole time period, while the overall mortality ranged from 1.80 % in 2013 to 1.20 % in 2017. The mean cost of treatment was 14517.81 RMB ($ 2147.92) per individual, and the mean duration of hospital stay was 9.25 days.\nWe provide an overview of mortality related to SE in China as the HQMS database covers a large number of cases of SE in China, making it one of the most efficient tools for mortality investigation. The use of electronic medical records in China creates several challenges and here we discuss lessons learned. The methodology will be improved and will be used in future studies.",

        "title": "Impact of Reperfusion for Nonagenarians Treated by Mechanical Thrombectomy: Insights From the ETIS Registry.",
        "abstract": "\nBackground and Purpose- Nonagenarians represent a growing stroke population characterized by a higher frailty. Although endovascular therapy (ET) is a cornerstone of the management of acute ischemic stroke related to large vessel occlusion, the benefit of reperfusion among nonagenarians is poorly documented. We aimed to assess the impact of ET-related reperfusion on the functional outcome of reperfusion in this elderly population. Methods- A retrospective analysis of clinical and imaging data from all patients aged over 90 included in the ETIS (Endovascular Treatment in Ischemic Stroke) registry between October 2013 and April 2018 was performed. Association between post-ET reperfusion and favorable (modified Rankin Scale [0-2] or equal to prestroke value) and good (modified Rankin Scale [0-3] or equal to prestroke value) outcome were evaluated. Demographic and procedural predictors of functional outcome, including the first-pass effect, were evaluated. Results were adjusted for center, admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and use of intravenous thrombolysis. Results- Among the 124 nonagenarians treated with ET, those with successful reperfusion had the lowest 90-day modified Rankin Scale (odds ratio, 3.26; 95% CI, 1.04-10.25). Only patients with successful reperfusion after the first pass (n=53, 56.7%) had a reduced 90-day mortality (odds ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05-0.45) and an increased rate of good outcome (odds ratio, 4.55; 95% CI, 1.38-15.03). No increase in the rate of intracranial hemorrhage was observed among patients successfully reperfused. Conclusions- Successful reperfusion improves the functional outcome of nonagenarians who should not be excluded from ET. The first-pass effect should be considered in the procedural management of this frail population.",

In this study, the role and molecular mechanism of IL-17A in autophagy were further explored under ischemic condition. We found that exogenous addition of rmIL-17A remarkably (P < 0.001) decreased cell viability, which companying with the increases of LC3 II accumulation (P < 0.05 or 0.01) and Beclin 1 levels (P < 0.05 or 0.001), and reduction of p62 levels (P < 0.01 or 0.001) in OGD/R-treated cortical neurons (n = 6). The levels of P-mTOR (Ser 2448) (P < 0.001) and P-S6 (Ser 240/244) (P < 0.01) significantly decreased without the involvement of Akt, ERK1/2 and AMPK in cortical neurons under rmIL-17A and OGD/R treatments (n = 6). Interestingly, the co-IP analysis exhibited that PP2B and mTOR could be reciprocally immunoprecipitated; and the addition of rmIL-17A increased their interactions, PP2B activities (P < 0.001), P-Src (P < 0.001), and P-PLC&#947;1 (P < 0.01) levels in OGD/R-treated neurons (n = 6 or 5). The PP2B inhibitor Cyclosporin A blocked the induction of excessive autophagy (P < 0.05 or <0.001) and increased cell viability (P < 0.001) after OGD/R and rmIL-17A treatments (n = 6). In addition, the ICV injection of IL-17A neutralizing mAb could attenuate autophagy levels (P < 0.01 or 0.001, n = 6) and improve neurological functions (P < 0.01 or 0.001, n = 10) of mice after 1 h MCAO/R 24 h or 7 d. These results suggested that IL-17A-mediated excessive autophagy aggravates neuronal ischemic injuries via Src-PP2B-mTOR pathway, and IL-17A neutralization may provide a potential therapeutic effect for ischemic stroke.",

        "title": "A Single-Scan, Rapid Whole-Brain Protocol for Quantitative Water Content Mapping With Neurobiological Implications.",
        "abstract": "\nWater concentration is tightly regulated in the healthy human brain and changes only slightly with age and gender in healthy subjects. Consequently, changes in water content are important for the characterization of disease. MRI can be used to measure changes in brain water content, but as these changes are usually in the low percentage range, highly accurate and precise methods are required for detection. The method proposed here is based on a long-TR (10 s) multiple-echo gradient-echo measurement with an acquisition time of 7:21 min. Using such a long TR ensures that there is no T1 weighting, meaning that the image intensity at zero echo time is only proportional to the water content, the transmit field, and to the receive field. The receive and transmit corrections, which are increasingly large at higher field strengths and for highly segmented coil arrays, are multiplicative and can be approached heuristically using a bias field correction. The method was tested on 21 healthy volunteers at 3T field strength. Calibration using cerebral-spinal fluid values (~100% water content) resulted in mean values and standard deviations of the water content distribution in white matter and gray matter of 69.1% (1.7%) and 83.7% (1.2%), respectively. Measured distributions were coil-independent, as seen by using either a 12-channel receiver coil or a 32-channel receiver coil. In a test-retest investigation using 12 scans on one volunteer, the variation in the mean value of water content for different tissue types was ~0.3% and the mean voxel variability was ~1%. Robustness against reduced SNR was assessed by comparing results for 5 additional volunteers at 1.5T and 3T. Furthermore, water content distribution in gray matter is investigated and regional contrast reported for the first time. Clinical applicability is illustrated with data from one stroke patient and one brain tumor patient. It is anticipated that this fast, stable, easy-to-use, high-quality mapping method will facilitate routine quantitative MR imaging of water content.",

        "abstract": "\nAs acute stroke treatments advance, more people survive the initial stroke event and live with long-term neurological impairments that impact functional outcomes and quality of life. In accordance with International Classification of Functioning (ICF), living with long-term neurological impairments can limit survivors' activity performance and restrict participation in valued life roles and routines. Research focused on longitudinal analysis of functional measures and outcomes after stroke are critical for determining early indicators of long-term participation and quality of life and guiding rehabilitation resource allocation. As core members of the interdisciplinary stroke recovery treatment team throughout the post-acute care continuum, occupational therapists (OTs) directly address stroke survivors' ability to participate in meaningful daily activities to promote function and quality of life. Just as in clinical care in which multidisciplinary, team-based perspectives are vital, OTs provide invaluable perspectives for stroke recovery research. Here we describe OTs' role in a collaborative, interdisciplinary research study aimed at comprehensively understanding upper extremity motor recovery after stroke and its impact on individuals across the post-acute care continuum. This article discusses the importance of the OTs' perspectives in conducting interdisciplinary, longitudinal stroke recovery research. The challenges, strategies and recommendations for future directions of advancing the role of OTs in multidisciplinary stroke recovery research are highlighted. We use this perspective as a call to action to the stroke recovery field to incorporate OTs as members of the research team and for OTs to provide their perspectives on ongoing stroke recovery research.",

While wearable sensors have the potential to alleviate these issues, many are beyond the financial capabilities of the majority of African persons and clinics. To bridge this gap, we have developed a low-cost wrist-worn sensor (the outREACH sensor) capable of accurately measuring upper limb movement kinematics. In this study we evaluated the extent to which the outREACH sensor is sensitive to the hand performing the task (unimpaired, impaired) and level of impairment (mild, moderate) in 14 Ethiopian persons with acquired brain injury (mean age = 51.6 &#177; 12.2 years, 1 female, 13 male). Participants performed an object manipulation task with both the impaired and the unimpaired limb, and reaching performance was measured using standard kinematic measures (i.e., movement time, spectral arc length, peak velocity, peak acceleration, mean velocity, mean acceleration). Overall, movements were smoother and faster when performed by the patient's unimpaired limb. In contrast, maximum velocity did not differ between the two limbs. Moreover, the outREACH sensor was sensitive to differences in performance-based upper limb impairment. Fugl-Meyer assessment for upper extremity scores were significantly correlated with movement time, spectral arc length, and peak velocity. Upper limb movement kinematics can be accurately measured using the outREACH sensor. The outREACH sensor can be a valuable addition to standardized clinical measures that provides rehabilitation clinicians with information regarding initial upper limb impairment level and changes in function across the rehabilitation lifespan.",

His motor features dramatically improved after the operation; however, he developed dysarthria and a refractory wheeze associated with dyspnea due to abnormal hyperadduction of the false vocal fold. By adjusting the stimulation site of STN, his severe wheeze, which was considered to be the result of the unfavorable spread of current to the corticobulbar tract, was significantly improved. This report provides concrete evidence that wheezing is caused by hyperadduction of the false vocal fold as an adverse effect of STN-DBS and can be reversed by adjusting the stimulation site for STN-DBS.",

Both neutrophil and platelet have been associated with the stroke progression. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between neutrophil-to-platelet ratio (NPR) and HT after acute ischemic stroke. Methods: A total of 279 stroke patients with HT were consecutively recruited. HT was diagnosed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) and classified into hemorrhagic infarction (HI) and parenchymal hematoma (PH). Blood samples for neutrophil and platelet counts were obtained at admission. Meanwhile, 270 age- and gender-matched controls without HT were included for comparison. Results: Among the patients with HT, 131 patients had PH and 148 patients had HI. NPR was higher in patients with PH than those with HI or non-HT [36.8 (23.7-49.2) vs. 26.6 (17.9-38.3) vs. 19.1 (14.8-24.8), P < 0.001]. After adjustment for potential confounders, high NPR remained independently associated with the increased risk of HT (OR = 2.000, 95% CI: 1.041-3.843, P = 0.037). NPR (>39.9) was independently associated with PH (OR = 2.641, 95% CI: 1.308-5.342, P = 0.007).

        "abstract": "\nTrauma is among the leading causes of death in the United States. Technological advancements have led to the development of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) which offers a pre-hospital option to non-compressible hemorrhage control. Due to the prevalence of concomitant traumatic brain injury (TBI), an understanding of the effects of REBOA on cerebral physiology is critical. To further this understanding, we employed a rat model of penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI). PBBI produced an injury pattern within the right frontal cortex and striatum that replicates the pathology from a penetrating ballistic round. Aortic occlusion was initiated 30 min post-PBBI and maintained continuously (cAO) or intermittently (iAO) for 30 min. Continuous measurements of mean arterial pressure (MAP), intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO2) were recorded during, and for 60 min following occlusion. PBBI increased ICP and decreased CBF and PbtO2. The arterial balloon catheter effectively occluded the descending aorta which augmented MAP in the carotid artery. Despite this, CBF levels were not changed by aortic occlusion. iAO caused sustained adverse effects to ICP and PbtO2 while cAO demonstrated no adverse effects on either. Temporary increases in PbtO2 were observed during occlusion, along with restoration of sham levels of ICP for the remainder of the recordings. These results suggest that iAO may lead to prolonged cerebral hypertension following PBBI. Following cAO, ICP, and PbtO2 levels were temporarily improved. This information warrants further investigation using TBI-polytrauma model and provides foundational knowledge surrounding the non-hemorrhage applications of REBOA including neurogenic shock and stroke.",

Results: A total of 21 patients met the inclusion criteria (mean aged 11.14 &#177; 2.82, male: female = 11:10). Six patients (28.6%) showed no cognitive deficits in any index score, while 15 (71.4%) showed cognitive deficits with differing severity.

The aim of this study is to compare the four anthropometric indexes (body mass index, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio) and identify the index that is most closely related to stroke in areas with high incidence of stroke. Methods: A total of 4,052 participants aged 40 years or older were selected by the multistage stratified cluster sampling method in Dehui City in Jilin province, China. Face-to-face interviews and physical examinations were conducted to collect the participants' information. Descriptive data analyses were conducted. Multivariable logistic analyses were used to explore the adjusted association between stroke and body fat measuring indexes. Results: For body mass index (adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.13, 95% confident interval (CI): 0.77-1.65), waist circumference (adjusted OR: 1.32, 95% CI: 0.88-1.99), and waist-to-hip ratio (adjusted OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 0.92-1.93), the patients in the highest quartile did not have a higher risk of stroke than those in the lowest quartile.

        "abstract": "\nSenkyunolide-H (SEH), a major bioactive compound extracted from Ligusticum chuanxiong, has been reported to be effective in preventing cerebral ischemic stroke (CIS). In this study, we employed network pharmacology to reveal potential mechanism of SEH against CIS on a system level and confirmed the therapeutic effects of SEH on CIS by models of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion in vivo and in vitro. Through protein-protein interaction networks construction of SEH- and CIS-related targets, a total of 62 key targets were obtained by screening topological indices and analyzed for Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment. Gene Ontology analysis indicated that SEH might have a role in treating CIS via regulating some biological processes including regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway, phosphatidylinositol-mediated signaling, and some molecular function, such as transcription factor and protein phosphatase binding and nitric oxide synthase regulator activity. Meanwhile, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis showed that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway was significantly enriched. In addition, our result showed that SEH posttreatment significantly decreased the neurological scores, infarct volume, and neuronal death in the middle cerebral artery occlusion mice. Moreover, the PI3K/Akt/nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway was activated by intragastric administration of 40 mg/kg SEH, as verified by Western blot. In vitro, treatment of PC12 cells with 100 &#956;M SEH markedly reduced cell death induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation through the activation of PI3K/Akt/nuclear factor kappa B pathway, and the therapeutic effect of SEH was obviously inhibited by 10 &#956;M LY294002. In summary, these results suggested that SEH carries a therapeutic potential in CIS involving multiple targets and pathways, and the most crucial mechanism might be through the activation of PI3K/Akt/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#954;B) signaling pathway to inhibit inflammatory factor releases and increase the antiapoptosis capacity.

While vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are used to prevent embolic stroke, they have been shown to increase levels of both coronary and extracoronary artery calcification. This has not been studied for (intracranial) carotid arteries. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between VKA use and degree of ICAC. We tested our hypothesis in a cohort of patients with nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) of which a substantial part used VKAs. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively semiquantified ICAC on brain unenhanced CT of consecutive adult patients with nontraumatic ICH. Assessment was performed blinded to clinical characteristics and status of VKA use. We used a 5-point visual scale and dichotomized degree of ICAC in low and high degree. Patient demographics, VKA use, duration of VKA treatment, as well as known risk factors for intracranial calcification were collected. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the association between ICAC and VKA use. Results: Three hundred and seventy-six nontraumatic ICH patients were included of whom 77 were using VKAs (20.5%) with a median treatment duration of 35 months. Any degree of ICAC was detected in 289 patients (76.9%).

In multivariable regression analysis, only older age was significantly associated with a higher degree of ICAC (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.08), while VKA use was not (OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.67-2.24). Conclusions: Our findings do not support VKA use as an independent risk factor for higher ICAC degree in patients with ICH. We could not confirm the concerns about VKA use and intracranial carotid vascular calcification. We suggest further research in other cohorts with VKA users such as patients with ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground and Purpose: According to previous studies, the mean platelet volume-to-lymphocyte ratio (MPVLR) represents a novel marker of a poor short-term prognosis in patients with a myocardial infarction who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention. We aimed to evaluate the association between MPVLR and clinical outcomes of patients with acute ischemic stroke who were treated with intravenous thrombolysis. Methods: Two hundred forty-one patients with ischemic stroke receiving intravenous thrombolysis were prospectively enrolled in this study. Blood samples for MPVLR were obtained at admission and at 18-24 h after treatment with intravenous thrombolysis. A poor functional outcome was defined as a modified Rankin scale score of 3-6 at 3 months after stroke. Results: At admission, the area under the curve of MPVLR to predict poor functional outcomes at 3 months was 0.613 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.541-0.686; P = 0.003), and the best predictive MPVLR value was 5.8. Patients with an MPVLR &#8805;5.8 had a 3.141-fold increased risk of a poor outcome at 3 months (95% CI, 1.491-6.615; P = 0.003) compared to patients with an MPVLR <5.8. At 18-24 h after treatment with intravenous thrombolysis, the area under the curve of MPVLR to predict a poor outcome at 3 months was 0.697 (95% CI, 0.630-0.765, P < 0.001), and the best predictive MPVLR value was 6.9. The inclusion of MPVLR as a continuous (odds ratio, 1.145; 95% CI, 1.044-1.256, P = 0.004) and categorical variable (odds ratio, 6.555; 95% CI, 2.986-14.393, P < 0.001) was independently associated with poor outcomes at 3 months. Conclusions: Both the values of MPVLR at admission and 18-24 h after intravenous thrombolysis were independently associated with poor functional outcomes. MPVLR may serve as an activity marker for a poor prognosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving intravenous thrombolysis.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground: Stroke is one of the most common causes of death and disability worldwide. Subsequently, depression occurs in about one third of the stroke survivors. Health-related locus of control might serve as a modifiable cognitive factor to aid the recovery process. Aims: The present study aims to explore the role of health-related locus of control in the relation between subjective stroke impact and depressive symptoms after stroke. Methods: In the present cross-sectional study, N = 44 stroke patients (n = 18 female and n = 24 male) were recruited at two rehabilitation centers in Germany. Mean age was M = 65.8 (SD = 11.52, Range = 48-88). Self-report instruments included the stroke impact scale, health-related locus of control questionnaire, and Beck depression inventory. Data analysis was conducted in R using correlation and regression methods. Results: Subjective stroke impact and depressive symptoms were not directly associated (r s = -.20, p = .216). However, health-related locus of control moderated the relationship between subjective stroke impact and depressive symptoms (&#946; = -0.42, p = .015), revealing a stronger negative relationship when control of one`s health was attributed externally. Conclusion: The results indicate that health-related locus of control plays a role in the relationship of subjective stroke impact and depressive symptoms. It is recommended to focus on control beliefs during the recovery process of stroke survivors. For developing targeted interventions, it is necessary to further investigate these associations while incorporating various health-related control belief concepts and replicate the present findings among larger samples.",

        "abstract": "\nXiaoshuan enteric-coated capsule (XSEC) is a compound Chinese medicine widely used for the treatment of ischemic stroke. Enriched environment (EE) is a rehabilitative intervention designed to facilitate physical, cognitive, and social activity after brain injury. This study aimed to assess whether the XSEC and EE combination could provide synergistic efficacy in axonal remodeling compared to that with a single treatment after ischemic stroke using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by histological analysis. Rats were subjected to permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion and treated with XSEC and EE alone or in combination for 30 days. T2-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed to examine the infarct volume and axonal remodeling, respectively. The co-localization of Ki67 with NG2 or CNPase was examined by immunofluorescence staining to assess oligodendrogenesis. The expressions of growth associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and growth inhibitors NogoA/Nogo receptor (NgR)/RhoA/Rho-associated kinase2 (ROCK2) were measured using western blot and qRT-PCR. The Morris water maze (MWM) was performed to evaluate the cognitive function. MRI and histological measurements indicated XSEC and EE individually benefited axonal reorganization after stroke. Notably, XSEC + EE decreased infarct volume compared with XSEC or EE monotherapy and increased ipsilateral residual volume compared with vehicle group. DTI showed XSEC + EE robustly increased fractional anisotropy while decreased axial diffusivity and radial diffusivity in the injured cortex, striatum, and external capsule. Meanwhile, diffusion tensor tractography revealed XSEC + EE elevated fiber density in the cortex and external capsule and increased fiber length in the striatum and external capsule compared with the monotherapies. These MRI measurements, confirmed by histology, showed that XSEC + EE promoted axonal restoration. Additionally, XSEC + EE amplified oligodendrogenesis, decreased the expressions of NogoA/NgR/RhoA/ROCK2, and increased the expression of GAP-43 in the peri-infarct tissues. In parallel to these findings, rats treated with XSEC + EE exhibited higher cognitive recovery than those treated with XSEC or EE monotherapy, as evidenced by MWM test. Taken together, our data implicated that XSEC + EE exerted synergistic effects on alleviating atrophy and encouraging axonal reorganization partially by promoting oligodendrogenesis and overcoming intrinsic growth-inhibitory signaling, thereby facilitating higher cognitive recovery.",

        "abstract": "\nThe study of heat adaptation in military personnel offers generalizable insights into a variety of sporting, recreational and occupational populations. Conversely, certain characteristics of military employment have few parallels in civilian life, such as the imperative to achieve mission objectives during deployed operations, the opportunity to undergo training and selection for elite units or the requirement to fulfill essential duties under prolonged thermal stress. In such settings, achieving peak individual performance can be critical to organizational success. Short-notice deployment to a hot operational or training environment, exposure to high intensity exercise and undertaking ceremonial duties during extreme weather may challenge the ability to protect personnel from excessive thermal strain, especially where heat adaptation is incomplete. Graded and progressive acclimatization can reduce morbidity substantially and impact on mortality rates, yet individual variation in adaptation has the potential to undermine empirical approaches. Incapacity under heat stress can present the military with medical, occupational and logistic challenges requiring dynamic risk stratification during initial and subsequent heat stress. Using data from large studies of military personnel observing traditional and more contemporary acclimatization practices, this review article (1) characterizes the physical challenges that military training and deployed operations present (2) considers how heat adaptation has been used to augment military performance under thermal stress and (3) identifies potential solutions to optimize the risk-performance paradigm, including those with broader relevance to other populations exposed to heat stress.",

Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, accounting on its own for 2/3 of all dementia cases. The initial signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's disease relate to progressive cognitive decline, inexorably progressing until the loss of independence. Neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms may occur during the progression of the disease; around 20% of patients without any behavioral symptoms at the diagnosis will experience some of them within 2 years. Consequences are early institutionalization, lower quality of life, of both patients and carers, and more severe cognitive impairment. Treatment options for behavioral symptoms include pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. The latter are usually preferred, since antipsychotic therapy is not free from several, and often serious, adverse events. However, behavioral symptoms are not always controllable with non-pharmacological intervention. The psychotropic class of medication more frequently prescribed for behavioral symptoms are atypical antipsychotics; among them, risperidone is the only one licensed for the treatment of aggression, in Europe but not in the USA. On that regard, the use of antipsychotic drugs should be limited, due to the increased risk of mortality, stroke, hallucination, and higher risk of relapse after discontinuation. Some new agents are under evaluation, such as pimavanserin and lumateperone. In this review, we are evaluating the current available pharmacological options to treat behavioral symptoms as well as the forthcoming new agents.",

Salidroside has prominent anti-stroke effects in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion models. However, the underlying mechanisms of its actions are poorly understood. This study examined the anti-stroke effects of salidroside in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-induced rat model of stroke and its potential mechanisms involving the dopaminergic system. Salidroside administration increased the levels of dopamine (DA), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the ipsilateral striatum after induction of transient ischemia, which were assessed using microdialysis with high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrochemical detection (HPLC-ECD). Furthermore, treatment with salidroside ameliorated neurobehavioral impairment, assessed with the modified neurological severity scores (mNSS), the balance beam test, and the foot fault test. Moreover, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) suggested that MCAO-induced reduction in monoamine oxidase (MAO) was inhibited by salidroside. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analyses revealed high level of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the ipsilateral striatal caudate putamen (CPu) after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion, which could be further elevated by salidroside. In addition, salidroside could reverse the decreased immunoreactivity of TH in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). These results suggest that the anti-stroke effects of salidroside in MCAO-induced cerebral ischemia/reperfusion may involve the modulation of monoamine metabolism in the striatum and SNpc, which may be related to the function of the dopaminergic system in the rat brain.",

Post-stroke IGF-1 treatment reduced the infarct size by 34% and 38% in aged and adult rats, respectively. The IGF-1 treated adult rats also showed significant improvement in sensorimotor function following stroke, while this function was not significantly affected in aged rats. Furthermore, aged rats displayed exaggerated activation of microglia in the ischemic hemisphere. Significant reduction of microglial activation by IGF-1 was only detected at specific regions in the ipsilateral hemisphere of adult rats. We show that IGF-1 reduced infarct size in aged rats with an ischemic stroke.

Biological brain age can be estimated based on cortical and subcortical brain measures. For stroke patients, it could serve as a more sensitive marker of brain health than chronological age. In this study, we investigated whether there is a difference in brain age between stroke survivors and control participants matched on chronological age. We estimated brain age at 3 months after stroke, and then followed the longitudinal trajectory over three time-points: within 6 weeks (baseline), at 3 and at 12 months following their clinical event. We found that brain age in stroke participants was higher compared to controls, with the mean difference between the groups varying between 3.9 and 8.7 years depending on the brain measure used for prediction. This difference in brain age was observed at 6 weeks after stroke and maintained at 3 and 12 months after stroke. The presence of group differences already at baseline suggests that stroke might be an ultimate manifestation of gradual cerebrovascular burden accumulation and brain degeneration. Brain age prediction, therefore, has the potential to be a useful biomarker for quantifying stroke risk.",

Our results demonstrated that nodal global efficiency in frontal and parietal regions mediated the impairment of information processing speed related to periventricular WMH (PWMH). Additionally, we performed support vector machine (SVM) analysis and found that altered functional efficiency can identify WMH-CIND subjects with high accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. These findings suggest impaired functional networks in WMH-CIND individuals and that decreased functional efficiency may be a feature of CI in WMH subjects.",

        "abstract": "\nNeuromusculoskeletal simulation provides a promising platform to inform the design of assistive devices or inform rehabilitation. For these applications, a simulation must be able to accurately represent the person of interest, such as an individual with a neurologic injury. If a simulation fails to predict how an individual recruits and coordinates their muscles during movement, it will have limited utility for informing design or rehabilitation. While inverse dynamic simulations have previously been used to evaluate anticipated responses from interventions, like orthopedic surgery or orthoses, they frequently struggle to accurately estimate muscle activations, even for tasks like walking. The simulated muscle activity often fails to represent experimentally measured muscle activity from electromyographic (EMG) recordings. Research has theorized that the nervous system may simplify the range of possible activations used during dynamic tasks, by constraining activations to weighted groups of muscles, referred to as muscle synergies. Synergies are altered after neurological injury, such as stroke or cerebral palsy (CP), and may provide a method for improving subject-specific models of neuromuscular control. The aim of this study was to test whether constraining simulation to synergies could improve estimated muscle activations compared to EMG data. We evaluated modeled muscle activations during gait for six typically developing (TD) children and six children with CP. Muscle activations were estimated with: (1) static optimization (SO), minimizing muscle activations squared, and (2) synergy SO (SynSO), minimizing synergy activations squared using the weights identified from EMG data for two to five synergies. While SynSO caused changes in estimated activations compared to SO, the correlation to EMG data was not higher in SynSO than SO for either TD or CP groups. The correlations to EMG were higher in CP than TD for both SO (CP: 0.48, TD: 0.36) and SynSO (CP: 0.46, TD: 0.26 for five synergies). Constraining activations to SynSO caused the simulated muscle stress to increase compared to SO for all individuals, causing a 157% increase with two synergies. These results suggest that constraining simulated activations in inverse dynamic simulations to subject-specific synergies alone may not improve estimation of muscle activations during gait for generic musculoskeletal models.",

        "abstract": "\nReal-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a promising non-invasive method for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). BCIs translate brain activity into signals that allow communication with the outside world. Visual and motor imagery are often used as information-encoding strategies, but can be challenging if not grounded in recent experience in these modalities, e.g., in patients with locked-in-syndrome (LIS). In contrast, somatosensory imagery might constitute a more suitable information-encoding strategy as the somatosensory function is often very robust. Somatosensory imagery has been shown to activate the somatotopic cortex, but it has been unclear so far whether it can be reliably detected on a single-trial level and successfully classified according to specific somatosensory imagery content. Using ultra-high field 7-T fMRI, we show reliable and high-accuracy single-trial decoding of left-foot (LF) vs. right-hand (RH) somatosensory imagery. Correspondingly, higher decoding accuracies were associated with greater spatial separation of hand and foot decoding-weight patterns in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). Exploiting these novel neuroscientific insights, we developed-and provide a proof of concept for-basic BCI communication by showing that binary (yes/no) answers encoded by somatosensory imagery can be decoded with high accuracy in simulated real-time (in 7 subjects) as well as in real-time (1 subject). This study demonstrates that body part-specific somatosensory imagery differentially activates somatosensory cortex in a topographically specific manner; evidence which was surprisingly still lacking in the literature. It also offers proof of concept for a novel somatosensory imagery-based fMRI-BCI control strategy, with particularly high potential for visually and motor-impaired patients. The strategy could also be transferred to lower MRI field strengths and to mobile functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Finally, given that communication BCIs provide the BCI user with a form of feedback based on their brain signals and can thus be considered as a specific form of neurofeedback, and that repeated use of a BCI has been shown to enhance underlying representations, we expect that the current BCI could also offer an interesting new approach for somatosensory rehabilitation training in the context of stroke and phantom limb pain.",

Eleven patients with severe paralysis of upper limb motor function in the chronic phase (seven men and four women; age: 54.7 &#177; 10.8 years; 44.0 &#177; 29.0 months post-stroke) participated in the study. Patients underwent an intervention consisting of therapy using KINVIS and conventional therapeutic exercise (TherEX) for 10 days. Our originally developed KiNvis&#8482; system was applied to induce KINVIS while watching the movement of the artificial hand. Clinical outcomes were examined to evaluate motor functions and resting-state brain functional connectivity (rsFC) by analyzing blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The outcomes of motor function (Fugle-Meyer Assessment, FMA) and spasticity (Modified Ashworth Scale, MAS) significantly improved after the intervention. The improvement in MAS scores for the fingers and the wrist flexors reached a minimum of clinically important differences. Before the intervention, strong and significant negative correlations between the motor functions and rsFC of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and premotor cortex (PMd) in the unaffected hemisphere was demonstrated. These strong correlations were disappeared after the intervention. A negative and strong correlation between the motor function and rsFC of the bilateral inferior parietal sulcus (IPS) significantly changed to strong and positive correlation after the intervention. These results may suggest that the combination approach of KINVIS therapy and TherEX improved motor functions and decreased spasticity in the paralyzed upper extremity after stroke in the chronic phase, possibly indicating the contribution of embodied-visual stimulation. The rsFC for the interhemispheric IPS and intrahemispheric IPL and PMd may be a possible regulatory factor for improving motor function and spasticity.

The aim of neurorehabilitation is to exploit interventions based on human and animal studies about learning and adaptation, as well as to show that the activation of experience-dependent neuronal plasticity augments functional recovery after stroke. Instead of teaching compensatory strategies that do not reduce impairment but allow the patient to return home as soon as possible, functional recovery might be more sustainable as it ensures a long-term reduction in impairment and an improvement in quality of life. At the same time, neurorehabilitation permits the scientific community to collect valuable data, which allows inferring about the principles of brain organization. Hence neuroscience sheds light on the mechanisms of learning new functions or relearning lost ones. However, current rehabilitation methods lack the exact operationalization of evidence gained from skill learning literature, leading to an urgent need to bridge motor learning theory and present clinical work in order to identify a set of ingredients and practical applications that could guide future interventions. This work aims to unify the neuroscientific literature relevant to the recovery process and rehabilitation practice in order to provide a synthesis of the principles that constitute an effective neurorehabilitation approach. Previous attempts to achieve this goal either focused on a subset of principles or did not link clinical application to the principles of motor learning and recovery. We identified 15 principles of motor learning based on existing literature: massed practice, spaced practice, dosage, task-specific practice, goal-oriented practice, variable practice, increasing difficulty, multisensory stimulation, rhythmic cueing, explicit feedback/knowledge of results, implicit feedback/knowledge of performance, modulate effector selection, action observation/embodied practice, motor imagery, and social interaction.

Meisoindigo, a second-generation derivative of indirubin, has general water solubility and is well-tolerated. Previous studies have shown that meisoindigo reduces inflammation by inhibiting leukocyte chemotaxis and migration. In the present study, we investigated the hypothesis that meisoindigo was also protective against ischemic stroke, then evaluated its underlying mechanisms. In vivo, adult male C57BL/6J wild-type mice were used to produce a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) stroke model. On day three after reperfusion, obvious improvement in neurological scores, infarct volume reduction and cerebral edema amelioration were observed in meisoindigo treatment. Moreover, immunofluorescence staining and western-blot showed that the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome and its associated proteins in neurons and microglia was inhibited by meisoindigo. The effects of Meisoindigo on NLRP3 inflammasome inactivation and increased the M2 phenotype of microglia/macrophage through shifting from a M1 phenotype, which was possibly mediated by inhibition of TLR4/NF-&#954;B. Furthermore, we verified the inhibitory effect of meisoindigo on TLR4/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway, and found that meisoindigo treatment could significantly suppressed the expression of TLR4/NF-&#954;B pathway-associated proteins in a dose-dependent manner, meanwhile, which resulted in downregulation of HMGB1 and IL-1&#946;. Next, we established an in vitro oxygen glucose deprivation/Reperfusion (OGD/R) model in HT-22 and BV2 cells to simulate ischemic conditions. Cytotoxicity assay showed that meisoindigo substantially improved relative cell vitality and in HT-22 and BV2 cells following OGD/R in vitro. After suffering OGD/R, the TLR4/NF-&#954;B pathway was activated, the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome-associated proteins and M1 microglia/macrophage were increased, but meisoindigo could inhibit above changes in both HT-22 and BV2 cells. Additionally, though lipopolysaccharide stimulated the activation of TLR4 signaling in OGD/R models, meisoindigo co-treatment markedly reversed the upregulation of TLR4 and following activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and polarization of M1 microglia/macrophages mediated by TLR4. Overall, we demonstrate for the first time that meisoindigo post-treatment alleviates brain damage induced by ischemic stroke in vivo and in vitro experiments through blocking activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and regulating the polarization of microglia/macrophages via inhibition of the TLR4/NF-&#954;B signaling pathway.",

        "abstract": "\nDevelopment of new stroke therapies requires animal models that recapitulate the pathophysiological and functional consequences of ischemic brain damage over time-frames relevant to the therapeutic intervention. This is particularly relevant for the rapidly developing area of stem cell therapies, where functional replacement of circuitry will require maturation of transplanted human cells over months. An additional challenge is the establishment of models of ischemia with stable behavioral phenotypes in chronically immune-suppressed animals to allow for long-term survival of human cell grafts. Here we report that microinjection of endothelin-1 into the sensorimotor cortex of athymic rats results in ischemic damage with a sustained deficit in function of the contralateral forepaw that persists for up to 9 months. The histological post-mortem analysis revealed chronic and diffuse atrophy of the ischemic cortical hemisphere that continued to progress over 9 months. Secondary atrophy remote to the primary site of injury and its relationship with long-term cognitive and functional decline is now recognized in human populations. Thus, focal cortical infarction in athymic rats mirrors important pathophysiological and functional features relevant to human stroke, and will be valuable for assessing efficacy of stem cell based therapies.",

        "abstract": "\nNeonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) encephalopathy is a severe disease for which there is currently no curative treatment. Recent evidence suggests that high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein can promote neuroinflammation after stroke in adult rodents, but its role in perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (HIBD) remains largely uninvestigated. In the present work, the potential role of HMGB1 in the pathogenesis of HIBD was explored. A HIBD model was established in postpartum day 7 rat pups. HMGB1 expression, the cellular distribution of HMGB1, and microglial activation were all evaluated. Glycyrrhizin (GL), an inhibitor of HMGB1, was used to investigate whether the inhibition of HMGB1 modulated microglial M1/M2 polarization or attenuated brain damage after HI. HAPI microglial cells and primary neurons were cultured in vitro and an oxygen-glucose deprivation model was established to evaluate the effects of different microglial-conditioned media on neurons using GL and recombinant HMGB1. Results showed that the expression of HMGB1 was increased in both the ipsilateral cortex and peripheral blood 72 h after HI. Immunofluorescence analyses showed that HMGB1 in the cortex was primarily expressed in neurons. This increase in cortical HMGB1 expression 72 h after HI was characterized by increased co-expression with microglia, rather than neurons or astrocytes. The expression of both M1 and M2 microglia was upregulated 72 h after HI. The administration of GL significantly suppressed M1 microglial polarization and promoted M2 microglial polarization. Meanwhile, GL pretreatment significantly alleviated brain edema and cerebral infarction. In vitro experimentation showed that HMGB1-induced M1-conditioned media aggravated neuronal damage, but this effect was neutralized by GL. These findings suggest that HMGB1 may result in an imbalance of M1/M2 microglial polarization in the cortex and thus cause neuronal injury. Pharmacological blockade of HMGB1 signaling may attenuate this imbalanced polarization of microglia and thus could be used as a therapeutic strategy against brain injury in HIBD.",

        "abstract": "\nNeurologic music therapy in rehabilitation of stroke patients has been shown to be a promising supplement to the often strenuous conventional rehabilitation strategies. The aim of this study was threefold: (i) replicate results from a previous study with a sample from one clinic (henceforth called Site 1; N = 12) using an already established recording system, and (ii) conceptually replicate previous findings with a less costly hand-tracking system in Site 2 (N = 30), and (iii) compare both sub-studies' outcomes to estimate the efficiency of neurologic music therapy. Stroke patients in both sites were randomly assigned to treatment or control groups and received daily training of guided sequential upper limb movements additional to their standard stroke rehabilitation protocol. Treatment groups received sonification (i.e., changes in musical pitch) of their movements when they moved their affected hand up and down to reproduce a sequence of the first six notes of a C major scale. Controls received the same movement protocol, however, without auditory feedback. Sensors at the upper arm and the forearm (Xsens) or an optic sensor device (Leapmotion) allowed to measure kinematics of movements and movement smoothness. Behavioral measures pre and post intervention included the Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) and the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) and movement data. Bayesian regression did not show evidence supporting an additional effect of sonification on clinical mobility assessments. However, combined movement data from both sites showed slight improvements in movement smoothness for the treatment group, and an advantage for one of the two motion capturing systems. Exploratory analyses of EEG-EMG phase coherence during movement of the paretic arm in a subset of patients suggested increases in cortico-muscular phase coherence specifically in the ipsilesional hemisphere after sonification therapy, but not after standard rehabilitation therapy. Our findings show that musical sonification is a viable treatment supplement to current neurorehabilitation methods, with limited clinical benefits. However, given patients' enthusiasm during training and the low hardware price of one of the systems it may be considered as an add-on home-based neurorehabilitation therapy.",

After induction of general anesthesia, before surgery began, preload optimization based on stroke volume (SV) variation following fluid challenge was performed. Then, an alveolar recruitment maneuver (ARM) through stepwise increase in positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was performed. Hemodynamic data were noted before, during, and after the alveolar recruitment maneuver.\nARM through stepwise increase in PEEP and CPAP were applied in 22 and 14 preload independent patients, respectively. Relative changes in SV during ARMs were significantly greater in the ARMCPAP group (-39 &#177; 20%) as compared to the ARMPEEP group (-15 &#177; 22%; P = 0.002).

The testing apparatus was set to move in a vertical direction to the tooth apex at two strokes per second with a 5 mm stroke for 15 seconds. The plaque substrate was then evaluated for maximum depth of the plaque removed. Results for all comparisons were statistically analyzed using the post hoc Tukey test for multiple pairwise comparisons and t-tests, assuming unequal variance, were used to compare mean depth of plaque removed for the same product under differing flossing pressures.\nThe mean plaque depth removed by GUM Expanding floss was greater than the mean plaque removed by the Reach Mint Waxed at 50 g (P< 0.05) and at 150 g (P< 0.001). The mean plaque depth removed by GUM Expanding floss was also greater than the Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean mean plaque depth removal at both 50 g and 150 g (P< 0.001). Reach Mint Waxed floss plaque removal efficacy was superior to the Oral-B Glide Pro-Health Deep Clean at 50 and 150 g (P< 0.001 for each).

        "abstract": "\nThe theoretical conceptualization of artistic ingenuity and creativity, as reflections of the highest-level cognitive functions in the human brain, has recently evolved from a purely philosophical pursuit to a compelling neuroscientific undertaking. Changes in artistic style have been extensively studied in association with brain dysfunction in the presence of neurological and psychiatric diseases in famous artists. This paper presents the case of Yannoulis Halepas (1851-1938), who is widely regarded as the most influential sculptor of modern Greek art. At the age of 27, already at the peak of his fame, Halepas abruptly abandoned the sculpture world after developing schizoaffective disorder, only to resurge onto the art scene after an almost 40-year-long hiatus with a fundamentally reformed artistic style. Two distinct periods have preoccupied art critics: Halepas's early premorbid years (1870-1878), which were imbued with the principles of neoclassicism, and the later postmorbid years (1918-1938), which mark the artist's transcendence to expressionism and contemporary art. From a neuroaesthetical perspective, the extensive and multifaceted oeuvre that Halepas produced in his lifetime allows a close study of his artistic development throughout and beyond mental disease. In addition, his lifework is a unique account in the history of art of the struggle of artistic genius with the limits of the rational mind and its conscious reality.",

Microelectrode recordings in the GPi and electromyographic (EMG) activity in the limbs were recorded and the mean spontaneous firing rates (MSFRs) were calculated. Spectral analysis was used to assess neuronal oscillatory patterns. Coherence analysis was applied to explore the relationship between oscillatory neurons and EMG.\nOf 79 GPi neurons, 50.6% oscillated at the tremor frequency; 25.3% oscillated at &#946; frequency, and 24.1% did not oscillate. The MSFR of all neurons was 81.5&#160;&#177;&#160;7.4 spikes/s. Among neurons oscillating at tremor frequency, 40% were coherent with the tremor. In four neurons, the pattern changed from tremor frequency to &#946; frequency or vice versa. It appeared that the tremor began before the GPi fired bursts.\nSome neuronal activity in the GPi correlates with tremor and this correlation might be due to either feedback, maintenance, or initiation. Since there were examples of EMG tremor prior to GPi activity, initiation seems least likely. The data further support the prediction of the classic pathophysiology model of Parkinson's disease.",

We compared right ventricular end-diastolic and systolic volumes indexed to body surface area (RVEDVi and RVESVi) and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) as primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints were indexed left ventricular diastolic and systolic volume (LVEDVi and LVESVi), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), right ventricular (RV) sinus ejection fraction (EF) and RV outflow tract EF (RVOT EF).\nSeventy-nine patients were included in the analysis; 40 underwent RVIS and 39 underwent TI repair. None of the patients in the TI repair group had an initial palliation with a systemic to pulmonary arterial shunt compared to seven (18%) in the RVIS group (P&#160;<&#160;.01). There was no appreciable difference in RVEDVi (122&#160;&#177;&#160;29 cc/m2 vs 130&#160;&#177;&#160;29&#160;cc/m2 , P&#160;=&#160;.59) or pulmonary regurgitant fraction (40&#160;&#177;&#160;13 vs 37&#160;&#177;&#160;18, P&#160;=&#160;.29) between the RVIS and TI groups. Compared to the TI group, the RVIS group had higher RVEF (54&#160;&#177;&#160;6% vs 44&#160;&#177;&#160;9%, P&#160;<&#160;.01), lower RVESV (57&#160;&#177;&#160;17 cc/m2 vs 67&#160;&#177;&#160;25 cc/m2 , P&#160;=&#160;.03), higher LVEF (61&#160;&#177;&#160;11% vs 54&#160;&#177;&#160;8%, P&#160;<&#160;.01), higher RVOT EF (47&#160;&#177;&#160;12% vs 41&#160;&#177;&#160;11%, P&#160;=&#160;.03), and higher RV sinus EF (56&#160;&#177;&#160;5% vs 49&#160;&#177;&#160;6%, P&#160;<&#160;.01) CONCLUSIONS: In this selected cohort, patients who underwent RVIS repair for TOF had higher right and left ventricular ejection fraction compared to those who underwent TI repair.",

The objective of the present study was to examine the intersectionality between race/ethnicity, insurance status, and postoperative outcomes in carotid procedures.\nRecords of adults from 2007 to 2014 were retrospectively identified, and patients with appropriate International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision Clinical Modification codes for carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting were identified. Primary outcomes were unadjusted rates and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of postoperative in-hospital mortality, stroke, combined stroke/mortality, and cardiovascular complications.\nData were sourced from the State Inpatient Databases data from California, Florida, Kentucky, Maryland, and New York during the years 2007 to 2014.\nPatients undergoing carotid revascularization procedures.\nThe effects of race and insurance status as independent variables and as effect modifiers on postoperative outcomes.\nMultivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between race and/or insurance status with respect to study outcomes. Race, but not payer status, was significantly associated with adverse outcomes after carotid artery procedures, with blacks, Hispanics, and other non-Caucasian races demonstrating a significantly greater risk of postoperative stroke and mortality (aOR range 1.24-1.59). This relationship persisted even when stratified by procedure type (aOR range 1.25-1.56) and symptomatology (aOR range 1.51-1.63).\nThese results suggest that disparities in postoperative outcomes after carotid artery procedures are associated with race but not with primary insurance status. Multiple contributing factors exist, including racial inequities in prevalence of comorbidities, health literacy, and procedure type performed.",

Brain water content and BBB integrity as well as neurological function were also examined after PG administration. In addition, the mechanism by which CCL2-mediated BBB injury was further investigated by cell coculture. Our findings showed that PG could effectively reduce brain edema and improve neurobehavioral functions. p-p38 MAPK and AQP4 expression were significantly inhibited by PG in vivo and in vitro. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of PG in neuroprotecting the BBB integrity by inhibition of CCL2-CCR2-p38 MAPK pathway following ICH, targeting CCL2 could be developed as a novel treatment for hemorrhagic stroke.",

Inflammasome activation is a ubiquitous but poorly understood consequence of acute ischemic stroke. Here, we investigated the potential contributions of HDAC3 to inflammasome activation in primary cultured microglia and experimental stroke models. In this study, we documented that HDAC3 expression was increased in microglia of mouse experimental stroke model. Intraperitoneal injection of RGFP966 (a selective inhibitor of HDAC3) decreased infarct size and alleviated neurological deficits after the onset of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). In vitro data indicated that LPS stimulation evoked a time-dependent increase of HDAC3 and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) inflammasome in primary cultured microglia. Interestingly, AIM2 was subjected to spatiotemporal regulation by RGFP966. The ability of RGFP966 to inhibit the AIM2 inflammasome was confirmed in an experimental mouse model of stroke. As expected, AIM2 knockout mice also demonstrated significant resistance to ischemia injury compared with their wild-type littermates. RGFP966 failed to exhibit extra protective effects in AIM2-/- stroke mice. Furthermore, we found that RGFP966 enhanced STAT1 acetylation and subsequently attenuated STAT1 phosphorylation, which may at least partially contributed to the negative regulation of AIM2 by RGFP966. Together, we initially found that RGFP966 alleviated the inflammatory response and protected against ischemic stroke by regulating the AIM2 inflammasome.",

Using an overexpression strategy, we have systematically investigated the role of protease activated receptors (PAR)-1, -2, -3, and -4 on FSAP-mediated signaling in HEK293T and A549 cells. Cleavage of PAR-reporter constructs and MAPK phosphorylation was used to monitor receptor activation. FSAP cleaved PAR-2 and to a lesser degree PAR-1, but not PAR-3 or PAR-4 in both cell types. Robust MAPK activation in response to FSAP was observed after PAR-2, but not PAR-1 overexpression in HEK293T. Recombinant serine protease domain of wild type FSAP, but not the Marburg I isoform of FSAP, could reproduce the effects of plasma purified FSAP. Canonical cleavage of both PARs was suggested by mass spectrometric analysis of synthetic peptide substrates from the N-terminus of PARs and site directed mutagenesis studies. Surprisingly, knockdown of endogenous PAR-1, but not PAR-2, prevented the apoptosis-inhibitory effect of FSAP, suggesting that PAR1 is nevertheless a direct or indirect target in some cell types. This molecular characterization of PAR-1 and -2 as cellular receptors of FSAP will help to define the actions of FSAP in the context of cancer and vascular biology.",

The ketone body &#946;-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) is an endogenous metabolic intermediate that protects against stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The present study aims to elucidate the protective effects of BHBA in the early stage of AD model and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Three-and-half-month-old double-transgenic mice (5XFAD) overexpressing &#946;-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PS1) were used as the AD model. The 5XFAD mice received 1.5&#160;mmol/kg/d BHBA subcutaneously for 28&#160;days. Morris water maze test, nest construction, and passive avoidance experiments were performed to assess the therapeutic effects on AD prevention in vivo, and brain pathology of 5XFAD mice including amyloid plaque deposition and microglia activation were assessed. Gene expression profiles in the cortexes of 5XFAD- and BHBA-treated 5XFAD mice were performed with high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. Mouse HT22 cells were treated with 2&#160;mM BHBA to explore its in vitro protective effects of BHBA on hippocampal neurons against A&#946; oligomer toxicity, ATP production, ROS generation, and mitochondrial aerobic respiratory function. APP, BACE1, and neprilysin (NEP) expression levels were evaluated in HT22 cells following treatment with BHBA by measuring the presence or absence of G protein-coupled receptor 109A (GPR109A). BHBA improved cognitive function of 5XFAD mice in Morris water maze test, nesting construction and passive avoidance experiments, and attenuated A&#946; accumulation and microglia overactivation in the brain. BHBA also enhanced mitochondrial respiratory function of hippocampal neurons and protected it from A&#946; toxicity. The enzymes, APP and NEP were regulated by BHBA via G-protein-coupled receptor 109A (GPR109A). Furthermore, RNA sequencing revealed that BHBA-regulated genes mainly annotated in aging, immune system, nervous system, and neurodegenerative diseases. Our data suggested that BHBA confers protection against the AD-like pathological events in the AD mouse model by targeting multiple aspects of AD and it may become a promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of AD.",

        "abstract": "\nThe Slack (KCNT1) gene encodes sodium-activated potassium channels that are abundantly expressed in the central nervous system. Human mutations alter the function of Slack channels, resulting in epilepsy and intellectual disability. Most of the disease-causing mutations are located in the extended cytoplasmic C-terminus of Slack channels and result in increased Slack current. Previous experiments have shown that the C-terminus of Slack channels binds a number of cytoplasmic signaling proteins. One of these is Phactr1, an actin-binding protein that recruits protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to certain phosphoprotein substrates. Using co-immunoprecipitation, we found that Phactr1 is required to link the channels to actin. Using patch clamp recordings, we found that co-expression of Phactr1 with wild-type Slack channels reduces the current amplitude but has no effect on Slack channels in which a conserved PKC phosphorylation site (S407) that regulates the current amplitude has been mutated. Furthermore, a Phactr1 mutant that disrupts the binding of PP1 but not that of actin fails to alter Slack currents. Our data suggest that Phactr1 regulates the Slack by linking PP1 to the channel. Targeting Slack-Phactr1 interactions may therefore be helpful in developing the novel therapies for brain disorders associated with the malfunction of Slack channels.",

Pulmonary arterial capacitance is a novel right heart catheterization derived hemodynamic metric representing pulmonary arterial tree distensibility and right ventricle afterload. Given the strong association between heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and kidney function, the goal of this study is to investigate the correlation between Pulmonary arterial capacitance and long-term renal function in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. In this retrospective single center study, data from 951 patients with the diagnosis of heart failure, who underwent right heart catheterization were analyzed. Eight hundred and one patients with reduced ejection fraction, end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis, acute myocardial infarction, and severe structural valvular disorders, were excluded. Pulmonary arterial capacitance was calculated as the stroke volume divided by pulmonary artery pulse pressure (mL/mmHg). Hemodynamic and clinical variables including baseline renal function were obtained at the time of the right heart catheterization, and renal function was also obtained at 3-5 years after right heart catheterization. The final cohort consisted of 150 subjects with a mean age 68 ( &#177; 14.2) years, 93 (62%) were female. The mean value for Pulmonary arterial capacitance was 2.82 ( &#177; 2.22) mL/mm Hg and the mean Glomerular Filtration Rate was 60.32 mL/min/l.73 m&#178; ( &#177; 28.36). After multivariate linear regression analysis (including baseline Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate as one of the variates), only age and Pulmonary arterial capacitance greater than 2.22 mL/mm Hg were predictors of long term Glomerular Filtration Rate. Pulmonary arterial capacitance as a novel right heart catheterization index could be a predictor of long-term renal function in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.",

To find a new intervention target to protect hypoxic cerebral tissue and a potential biomarker from reflecting the severity of hypoxia after ischemic stroke, our research explored the expression pattern and function of the regulator of reprogramming in cerebral hypoxia-induced injury. The expression pattern and the function of the regulator of reprogramming were explored in mice with middle cerebral artery occlusion, and human brain microvascular endothelial cells underwent oxygen-glucose deprivation treatment. A case-control study, including 223 ischemic stroke patients and 155 controls were also conducted to investigate its correlation with ischemic stroke clinical characteristics. Results showed that the regulator of reprogramming increased significantly in middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice (P < 0.05), and its level remained stable within 2 to 48 h after the implement of middle cerebral artery occlusion. Oxygen-glucose deprivation up-regulated the expression of regulator of reprogramming, and regulator of reprogramming promoted ASK-1/STRAP/14-3-3 complex formation to inhibit the activation of TNF-&#945;/ASK-1-mediated apoptosis of human brain microvascular endothelial cells, while small interfering ribonucleic acid (RNA) targeting regulator of reprogramming amplified these effects. Regulator of reprogramming increased and maintained stable within 3 to 48 h of ischemic stroke onset in patients, and was negatively associated with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) (r = -0.708, P < 0.001), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) (r = -0.683, P < 0.001) level, infarct volume (r = -0.579, P < 0.001), and modified Rankin scale (mRS) (r = -0.728, P < 0.001). These results indicate that the regulator of reprogramming can alleviate cerebral hypoxia-induced injury by suppressing TNF&#945;-induced apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells.",

        "abstract": "\nThe impact of remote limb ischemic conditioning on poststroke cognitive impairment was evaluated with 104 first-time patients of noncardiac ischemic stroke. During the acute phase the patients were randomized into control and remote limb ischemic conditioning groups. Both groups received standard treatment, while the remote limb ischemic conditioning group received additional remote limb ischemic conditioning treatment for 6 months. All participants underwent neuropsychological evaluation, transcranial Doppler detection, P300 event-related potential and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity measurements, and determination of serum intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and endothelin-1 levels both at admission and 6 months poststroke. The number of cases with poststroke cognitive impairment in each group was evaluated 6 months poststroke. No statistically significant difference was found in demographic data or baseline detection indices at admission between the two groups. However, at 6 months poststroke, the remote limb ischemic conditioning group had significantly higher total Montreal Cognitive Assessment score and its domains of visuospatial and executive functioning and attention scores, significantly lower activity of daily living scale score, shorter P300 latency, and higher amplitude compared with the control group. Moreover, the middle cerebral artery, average blood flow velocity was significantly higher, while the middle cerebral artery-pulsation index, basilar artery pulsation index, and the levels of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and endothelin-1 were significantly lower in the remote limb ischemic conditioning group compared with the control group. These results demonstrate that remote limb ischemic conditioning causes a significant improvement in cognitive domains, such as visuospatial and executive functioning and attention, and is therefore linked with reduced incidence of poststroke cognitive impairment.",

Here, we compare for the first time the expression patterns and colocalization degrees of the two AQPs in control brain tissue and in peri-ischemic regions, on tissue obtained from eight patients with confirmed ischemic pathology and from five control cases. Our analysis showed that AQP4 is more abundant that AQP1, especially in the cortex and in the organized scar areas. The colocalization of the two markers was high, both located on the astrocytes membranes, but the colocalization degree decreased in the scar peri-ischemic regions.

        "title": "Toxicity and health impact of nanoparticles. Basic biology and clinical perspective.",
        "abstract": "\nStroke has limited restorative treatment options. In search of new therapeutic strategies for the ischemic brain, cell-based therapies offered new hope, which has been, in the meanwhile, converted into a more realistic approach recognizing difficulties related to unfavorable environments causing low survival rates of transplanted neuronal precursors. Stem cell therapies are based on the transplantation of neuronal precursor cells (NPCs), adult stem cells propagated in cell culture or inducible pluripotent cells (iPSCs) obtained from patients and trans-differentiated into neural cells. Of these, autologous iPSCs have the advantage to be used in stroke patients because they do not raise ethical concerns and the risk of graft rejection is low. However, the use of stem cells for stroke therapy in humans has to take into account many factors including, dosage, route of administration, toxicity and side effects. For example, nanoparticles (NPs) may increase the efficacy of drugs and therapeutic cells delivery to the diseased brain. Medication dosages are generally determined by clinical trials done in relatively young, healthy people. However, in vivo and clinical data evaluating the toxic effects of NPs on neural cells are still scarce especially in the aged brain, which has a decreased homeostatic capacity and a reduced ability to cope with internal and environmental stress, as compared to the young brain. Previous studies in rodents indicate that aging along with neurodegenerative diseases may promote a proinflammatory state and leads to the development of gliosis in the aged brains. On the other hand, the nonspecific interaction between the shell of NPs and brain proteins leads to the adsorption of opsonins on their surface, forming the so-called \"corona\", thereby becoming ideal candidates to attract phagocytic microglia resulting in NPs engulfment and thus exacerbating neuronal death. Therefore, when designing NPs for clinical use, it should be considered that their systemic administration is associated with potential risks, especially in the aged subjects. Recently, NPs have been shown in recent years to play a crucial role in cell signaling processes involved in stroke recovery. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are secreted by virtually all type of cells in the body and have been shown to reflect the physiological and metabolic status of the host cells. Thus, understanding the disease-specific contents of EVs would enable the discovery of novel predictive biomarkers.",

In recent years, interventional occlusion of the left atrial appendage (LAA) has become a common alternative. Besides showing non-inferiority in large trials compared with warfarin interventional LAA occlusion can lead to serious adverse events with most of them occurring peri-interventionally.\nA 75-year-old man with AF and recurrent gastrointestinal bleedings was referred for an interventional closure of the LAA. The intervention was successful with an ABBOTT&#174; Amulet device. Four months later, the patient had to be resuscitated. Return of spontaneous circulation occurred after 10&#8201;min. On hospital arrival, echocardiography revealed a pericardial tamponade and 2&#8201;L of blood were drained. A coronary angiogram revealed a lesion with active leakage of contrast agent in the proximal circumflex artery. The patient was transferred to the cardiac surgery department immediately. Intra-operatively a perforation of the tissue at the basis of the LAA close to the left main coronary artery was discovered. The occluder was excised and the LAA was closed by endocardial sutures.\nIn this report, we review the literature concerning interventional LAA occlusion and the reported cases of LAA perforation.

Hyperaldosteronism causes arterial hypertension and might predispose to stroke, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure.\nA 60-year-old obese woman with long-standing hypertension, hypokalaemia, and shortness of breath was admitted to our hospital. Hypertension was caused by primary hyperaldosteronism due to an adenoma of the adrenal gland. Detailed transthoracic echocardiography revealed diastolic dysfunction, disturbed ventricular-arterial interaction, and atrial compliance resulting in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF). Three months of aldosterone antagonist treatment improved ventricular-arterial coupling, while left ventricular diastolic and atrial dysfunction remained unchanged.\nPresumably, hyperaldosteronism is the reason for HFPEF in this case. Standard criteria to diagnose HFPEF include clinical symptoms of heart failure and an ejection fraction (EF) >50% as well as echocardiographically or invasively assessed elevated filling pressures. Single beat pressure-volume analysis gives insights on the pathophysiology of increased filling pressures, showing in our case diastolic dysfunction as well as disturbed ventricular-arterial interaction. Three months of aldosterone antagonist treatment reduced blood pressure with concomitant improvement of ventricular-arterial interaction, thereby reducing stroke work while stroke volume remained nearly unchanged.

Group 1: no depression (reference); Group 2: currently with depression symptom (CES-D10 score &#8805; 10, negative self-reported depression); Group 3: self-reported depression with no current symptom (CES-D10 score < 10, positive self-reported depression); and Group 4: self-reported depression with current symptom (CES-D10 score &#8805; 10, self-reported depression). Six self-reported CVDs were grouped into two related disorders, i.e., heart related disorders (HRD) including heart disease, myocardial infarction, and angina; and peripheral/vascular related disorders (PRD) including hypertension, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were used to evaluate the associations between depression and CVDs.\n17.3% of participants had self-reported depression, 15.3% were with current depression symptom, 10.5% were with HRD and 34.4% were with PRD. After adjusting for variables of demographics, sex, lifestyles, and comorbidities, compared to reference, people in Group 2 had a slightly increased odds, but most of them were not statistically significant; the ORs (95% CI) were 1.36 (1.18-1.58, P < 0.0001) for HRD and 1.20 (1.09-1.32, P < 0.001) for PRD in Group 3; for people in Group 4, the ORs (95% CI) were 1.31 (1.08-1.61, P < 0.01) for HRD and 1.17 (1.02-1.34, P < 0.05) for PRD. Sex- and age-stratified analyses suggested that the increased ORs were more prevalent in men and people aged < 65 years.\nSeniors with self-reported depression are associated with an increased risk of CVDs, the association varies by depression status, sex and age.",

        "abstract": "\nLysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LALD) is a rare genetic disease characterized by the accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in many organs, including the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, bone marrow, and vascular endothelium. Patients with LALD can appear asymptomatic until liver failure or premature sudden death from coronary artery disease, stroke, and aneurysm, which lead to the diagnosis. Herein, we present a diagnostic workup in a young 17-year-old female patient who manifested hepatosplenomegaly, elevated liver enzymes, severe dyslipidemia, and systemic atherosclerosis. Liver biopsy demonstrated over 90% diffuse microvesicular steatosis, lipid accumulation in Kupffer cells, and birefringent cholesteryl ester crystals. The diagnosis of LALD was proven by the decrease of lysosomal acid lipase activity in dried blood spots and by the detection of two compound heterozygous mutations in the LIPA gene: nonsense mutation G796T (Gly266Term) and splicing site mutation G894A (E8SJM). The patient started enzyme replacement therapy with sebelipase alfa. Following the 1-year treatment, the patient remained asymptomatic, her serum aminotransferase levels were normal, liver density increased due to lipid resorption, and plaque-associated stenosis of carotid artery regressed. Moreover, liver biopsy showed a decrease of cholesteryl ester crystals in Kupffer cells.",

Medically speaking, mixed dementia (MxD) is a heterogenous disorder mostly referred to the coexistence of AD and VaD. The weight of vascular contribution to AD phenotype is nowadays matter of debate. Despite great efforts in the field of neurodegeneration and cerebrovascular disease, controversy over the exact nature of their relation still remains, hampering progress in the specialty and raising doubts about the MxD concept validity. Is MxD a neglected clinical entity or a nosographic artifice? Starting from the assumption that recent advances in dementia classification and diagnostic criteria make this a propitious time to set up preventive and therapeutic strategies, this narrative review and opinion paper summarizes the literature concerning the questioned etiopathogenic overlap between AD and VaD and challenges the traditional view of MxD as the mere co-occurrence of different pure forms of dementia.",

However, studies investigating 30-day readmission following PCI for chronic total occlusion (CTO) are lacking.\nThe National-Readmission-Database (NRD) was queried to identify patients undergoing elective CTO PCI between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2016. We assessed the incidence, predictors, and cost of 30-day readmissions.\nA total of 30,579 CTO PCIs were identified in the NRD. After excluding patients who had acute myocardial infarction (n&#8239;=&#8239;14,852), the final cohort included 15,907 patients. In this group of patients, 254 patients (1.5%) expired during their index admission and, 1600 patients (10%) had an unplanned readmission within 30&#8239;days. Cardiac causes constituted 54.2% of all causes of readmission. During the readmission, 15.8% of patients had coronary angiography, 8.4% underwent PCI, and 0.9% underwent bypass grafting. Independent predictors of 30-day readmission included baseline characteristics [age (OR 0.99, 95%CI 0.98-0.99), female (OR 1.14, 95%CI 1.01-1.28), lung disease (OR 1.36, 95%CI 1.20-1.55), heart failure (OR 1.42, 95%CI 1.24-1.62), anemia (OR 1.30, 95%CI 1.12-1.50), vascular disease (OR 1.18, 95%CI 1.03-1.35), history of stroke (OR 1.50, 95%CI 1.28-1.76) and the presence of a defibrillator (OR 1.68, 95%CI 1.39-2.03)], and procedural complications [acute kidney injury (OR 1.55, 95%CI 1.33-1.80) and gastrointestinal bleeding (OR 1.67, 95%CI 1.03-2.71)].\nOne-tenth of patients undergoing CTO PCI are readmitted within 30-days, mostly for cardiac causes.

        "abstract": "\nImaging studies point to a posture (finger vs. hand) and domain-specific neural basis of gestures. Furthermore, modulation of gestures by theta burst stimulation (TBS) may depend on interhemispheric disinhibition.\nIn this randomized sham-controlled study, we hypothesized that dual site continuous TBS over left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG-L) and right inferior parietal gyrus (IPL-R) predominantly affects pantomime of finger postures. Furthermore, we predicted that dual cTBS improves imitation of hand gestures if the effect correlates with measures of callosal connectivity.\nForty-six healthy subjects participated in this study and were targeted with one train of TBS in different experimental sessions: baseline, sham, single site IFG-L, dual IFG-L/IPL-R, single site IPL-R. Gestures were evaluated by blinded raters using the Test for Upper Limb Apraxia (TULIA) and Postural Imitation Test (PIT). Callosal connectivity was analyzed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).\nDual cTBS significantly improved TULIAtotal (F [3, 28]&#160;=&#160;4.118, p&#160;=&#160;.009), but did not affect TULIApantomime. The beneficial effect was driven by the cTBS over IPL-R, which improved TULIAimitation (p&#160;=&#160;.038). Furthermore, TULIAimitation significantly correlated with the microstructure (fractional anisotropy) of the splenium (r&#160;=&#160;0.420, p&#160;=&#160;.026), corrected for age and whole brain volume.\nThe study suggests that inhibition of IPL-R largely accounted for improved gesturing, possibly through transcallosal facilitation of IPL-L. Therefore, the findings may be relevant for the treatment of apraxic stroke patients. Gesture pantomime and postural gestures escaped the modulation by dual cTBS, suggesting a more widespread and/or variable neural representation.",

This study investigated the predictive factors of poor prognosis in patients with HS.\nData were obtained and analyzed from the health records of patients diagnosed with heat illness at Ajou university hospital between January 2008 and December 2017. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the independent predictors of poor prognosis.\nThirty-six patients (median age, 54.5 years; 33 men) were included in the study. Poor prognosis was identified in 27.8% of the study population (10 patients). The levels of S100B protein, troponin I, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, and serum lactate were statistically significant in the univariate analysis. Multiple regression analysis revealed that poor prognosis was significantly associated with an increased S100B protein level (odds ratio, 177.37; 95% confidence interval, 2.59 to 12,143.80; P=0.016). The S100B protein cut-off level for predicting poor prognosis was 0.610 &#956;g/L (area under the curve, 0.906; 95% confidence interval, 0.00 to 1.00), with 86% sensitivity and 86% specificity.\nAn increased S100B protein level on emergency department admission is an independent prognostic factor of poor prognosis in patients with HS. Elevation of the S100B protein level represents a potential target for specific and prompt therapies in these patients.",

Thus, we aimed to derive and validate rules to estimate P_max.LV using anteroposterior chest radiography (chest_AP), which is performed for critically ill patients urgently needing determination of their personalized P_max.LV.\nA retrospective, cross-sectional study was performed with non-cardiac arrest adults who underwent chest_AP within 1 hour of computed tomography (derivation:validation=3:2). On chest_AP, we defined cardiac diameter (CD), distance from right cardiac border to midline (RB), and cardiac height (CH) from the carina to the uppermost point of left hemi-diaphragm. Setting point zero (0, 0) at the midpoint of the xiphisternal joint and designating leftward and upward directions as positive on x- and y-axes, we located P_max.LV (x_max.LV, y_max.LV). The coefficients of the following mathematically inferred rules were sought: x_max.LV=&#945;0*CD-RB; y_max.LV=&#946;0*CH+&#947;0 (&#945;0: mean of [x_max.LV+RB]/CD; &#946;0, &#947;0: representative coefficient and constant of linear regression model, respectively).\nAmong 360 cases (52.0&#177;18.3 years, 102 females), we derived: x_max.LV=0.643*CD-RB and y_max.LV=55-0.390*CH. This estimated P_max.LV (19&#177;11 mm) was as close as the averaged P_max.LV (19&#177;11 mm, P=0.13) and closer than the three equidistant points representing the current guidelines (67&#177;13, 56&#177;10, and 77&#177;17 mm; all P<0.001) to the reference identified on computed tomography. Thus, our findings were validated.\nPersonalized P_max.LV can be estimated using chest_AP.

The Korean Society for the Study of Obesity released the 2018 Obesity Fact Sheet to address the incidence of obesity-related comorbidities according to WC levels.\nData from the Korean National Health Insurance Service health examination database from 2009 to 2016 were analyzed. Abdominal obesity was defined as a WC &#8805;90 cm in men and &#8805;85 cm in women. Incidence rates of comorbidities and all-cause mortality rates were calculated after standardizing by age and sex based on the 2010 census.\nFrom 2009 to 2015, the incidence rates of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke increased both in men and women. Individuals with the lowest WC levels had the highest all-cause mortality rates followed by those with the highest WC levels in men, women, and the total population. The incidence rates of total cancer increased as WC levels escalated between 2009 and 2016. In men, the incidence rates of colorectal, prostate, and liver cancers increased as WC levels increased. The incidence rates of thyroid, colorectal, and stomach cancers increased as WC levels rose in women.

        "abstract": "\n30-day readmission rate is a quality metric often employed to represent hospital and provider performance. Currently, little is known regarding 30-day readmissions (30dRA) following spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH). The purpose of this study was to use a national database to identify risk factors and trends in 30dRAs following sICH.\n64,909 cases with a primary diagnosis of sICH were identified within the Nationwide Readmission Database (NRD) from 2010 through 2014. Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was used to adjust for the severity of each patient's comorbidities. A binary logistic regression model was constructed to identify predictors of 30-day readmission. Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to generate a pooled odd ratio (OR) describing the likelihood of experiencing a 30dRA according to year.\nThe 30dRA rate following sICH decreased from 13.9% in 2010 to 12.5% in 2014 (pooled OR = 0.90, 95% CI 0.87-0.94). Cerebrovascular and cardiovascular etiologies accounted for the greatest number of admissions (36.1%). Sodium abnormality, healthcare-associated infection, gastrostomy, venous thromboembolism, and ischemic stroke during the index admission were associated with 30-day readmission. Furthermore, patients who underwent ventriculostomy (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.03-1.38) and craniotomy (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.09-1.31) were more likely to be readmitted within 30 days. Hospital volume, hospital teaching status, mechanical ventilation, and tracheostomy did not affect 30dRAs. Median readmission costs increased from $9,875 in 2012 to $11,028 in 2014 (p = 0.040).\nThe overall U.S. 30dRA rate after sICH from 2010 to 2014 was 12.9% and decreased slightly during this time period, but associated costs increased.

Our objective was to understand patient and facility factors influencing preventive care quality for patients with TIA in the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA).\nWe analysed administrative data from a retrospective cohort of 3052 patients with TIA cared for in the emergency department (ED) or inpatient setting in 110 VHA facilities from October 2010 to September 2011. A composite quality indicator (QI score) pass rate was constructed from four process-related quality measures-carotid imaging, brain imaging, high or moderate potency statin and antithrombotic medication, associated with the ED visit or inpatient admission after the TIA. We tested a multilevel structural equation model where facility and patient characteristics, inpatient admission, and neurological consultation were predictors of the resident's composite QI score.\nPresenting with a speech deficit and higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) were positively related to inpatient admission. Being admitted increased the likelihood of neurology consultation, whereas history of dementia, weekend arrival and a higher CCI score made neurological consultation less likely. Speech deficit, higher CCI, inpatient admission and neurological consultation had direct positive effects on the composite quality score. Patients in facilities with fewer full-time equivalent neurology staff were less likely to be admitted or to have a neurology consultation. Facilities having greater organisational complexity and with a VHA stroke centre designation were more likely to provide a neurology consultation.\nBetter TIA preventive care could be achieved through increased inpatient admissions, or through enhanced neurology and other care resources in the ED and during follow-up care.",

Conventional and novel left ventricular (LV) and LA echocardiographic parameters between the three groups were assessed.\nEach group consisted of thirty patients.

It inhibits thrombus formation via inhibition of the P2Y12 purinergic receptor on platelets, which is important in their activation by ADP. However, the P2Y12 receptor has also been found to be expressed in both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Accumulated evidence suggests that purinergic receptors regulate important functions of bone turnover. Previous studies on the effect of clopidogrel on bone metabolism indicated potential harmful effects, but their results remain conflicting. Thus, clopidogrel treatment may affect bone healing, but it has not yet been studied.\nTo evaluate if continuous perioperative clopidogrel treatment has any negative effect on bone healing in the rabbit calvarial defect model.\nSixteen male white New Zealand rabbits were randomly assigned in two groups: One group received daily 3 mg/kg of clopidogrel per os and the other group received the vehicle alone for a week prior to the surgical procedures; the treatments were continued for another 6 wk postoperatively. The surgical procedures included generation of two circular calvarial defects 11 mm in diameter in every animal. After the 6-wk period of healing, postmortem radiographic and histomorphometric evaluation of the defects was performed.\nBoth the surgical procedures and the postoperative period were uneventful and well tolerated by all the animals, without any surgical wound dehiscence, signs of infection or other complication. New bone was formed either inwards from the defect margins or in the central portion of the defect as separated bony islets. While defect healing was still incomplete in both groups, the clopidogrel group had significantly improved radiographic healing scores. Moreover, the histomorphometric analysis showed that bone regeneration (%) was 28.07 &#177; 7.7 for the clopidogrel group and 19.47 &#177; 4.9 for the control group, showing a statistically significant difference between them (P = 0.018). Statistically significant difference was also found in the defect bridging (%), i.e. 72.17 &#177; 21.2 for the clopidogrel group and 41.17 &#177; 8.5 for the control group, respectively (P = 0.004), whereas there was no statistical difference in bone tissue density between the groups.\nOur results indicate that maintenance of perioperative clopidogrel treatment does not negatively affect bone healing but rather promotes it. Further research is needed in order to find useful applications of this finding.",

        "abstract": "\nAgeing population is now a global challenge, where physical deterioration is the common feature in elderly people. In addition, the diseases, such as spinal cord injury, stroke, and injury, could cause a partial or total loss of the ability of human locomotion. Thus, assistance is necessary for them to perform safe activities of daily living. Robotic hip exoskeletons are able to support ambulatory functions in elderly people and provide rehabilitation for the patients with gait impairments. They can also augment human performance during normal walking, loaded walking, and manual handling of heavy-duty tasks by providing assistive force/torque. In this article, a systematic review of robotic hip exoskeletons is presented, where biomechanics of the human hip joint, pathological gait pattern, and common approaches to the design of robotic hip exoskeletons are described. Finally, limitations of the available robotic hip exoskeletons and their possible future directions are discussed, which could serve a useful reference for the engineers and researchers to develop robotic hip exoskeletons with practical and plausible applications in geriatric orthopaedics.\nThe past decade has witnessed a remarkable progress in research and development of robotic hip exoskeletons. Our aim is to summarize recent developments of robotic hip exoskeletons for the engineers, clinician scientists and rehabilitation personnel to develop efficient robotic hip exoskeletons for practical and plausible applications.",

Since Chinese herbal medicine is widely used for the treatment of stroke, there is a need to evaluate its efficacy as an alternative treatment option. The aim of this paper is to carry out an overview of Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of stroke by summarizing and evaluating all existing Cochrane reviews.\nThe Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews was searched from its inception date to August 2019 using \"stroke\" and \"herbal medicine\" or \"traditional medicine\" as search terms. For the methodological quality assessment of the Cochrane reviews, the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool was used.\nEight Cochrane reviews that evaluated the efficacy of herbal medicine for the treatment of stroke were included in this overview. There were 71 randomized controlled trials, with 5770 patients in total. The AMSTAR scores of the Cochrane reviews included in this study ranged from 9 to 11 with a mean score of 10. Three reviews met all the 11-item criteria of the AMSTAR. All reviews presented potential efficacy of herbal medicine for stroke treatment in terms of improvement of neurological deficit.\nThis overview reveals the potential efficacy of herbal medicines for the treatment of stroke in terms of neurological deficit improvement. However, due to the high risk of bias in the reviews' studies, an affirmative conclusion for the recommendation of herbal medicine for clinical practice could not be drawn.",

        "abstract": "\nIt has been well-documented recently that 5 billion people globally lack surgical care. Also well-documented is the need to improve mass casualty disaster response. Many of the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for 2030-healthcare and economic milestones-require significant improvement in global surgical care, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. Trauma/stroke centres evolved in high-income countries with evidence that 24/7/365 surgical and critical care markedly improved morbidity and mortality for trauma and stroke and for cardiovascular events, difficult childbirth, acute abdomen. Duplication of emergency services, especially civilian and military, often results in suboptimal, expensive care. By combining all healthcare resources within the ongoing healthcare system, more efficient care for both individual emergencies and mass casualty situations can be achieved. We describe progress in establishing mass casualty centres in Chile and Pakistan. In both locations, planning among the stakeholders (primarily civilian and military) indicates the feasibility of such integrated surgical and emergency care. We also review other programmes and initiatives to provide integrated mass casualty disaster response. Integrated mass casualty centres are a feasible means to improve both day-to-day surgical care and mass casualty disaster response. The humanitarian aspect of mass casualty disasters facilitates integration among stakeholders-from local healthcare systems to military resources to international healthcare organisations. The benefits of mass casualty centres-both healthcare and economic-can facilitate achieving the 2030 UN SDGs.",

We report a case of a 49-year-old diabetic, non-hypertensive, postmenopausal female who presented with symptoms involving the left dorsal medulla along with right sided hemiparesis and left UMN-type facial palsy. Contralateral hemiparesis was explained by caudal extension of infarct involving the pyramids before decussation at the medulla, known as Babinski-Nageotte Syndrome. UMN-type facial palsy was attributed to involvement of hypothetical supranuclear aberrant corticobulbar fibres of facial nerve which descend down in the contralateral ventromedial medulla, decussate at level of upper medulla and then ascend in the dorsolateral medulla to reach the facial nerve nucleus. Association of these two entities with Wallenberg's Syndrome have been reported separately in literature, but not together as in this case.",

We aimed to elucidate the association of OSA with subsequent cardiovascular events in patients with ACS with or without DM.\nIn this prospective cohort study, consecutive eligible patients with ACS underwent cardiorespiratory polygraphy between June 2015 and May 2017. OSA was defined as an Apnea Hypopnea Index &#8805;15 events/hour. The primary end point was major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs), including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, ischemia-driven revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina or heart failure.\nAmong 804 patients, 248 (30.8%) had DM and 403 (50.1%) had OSA. OSA was associated with 2.5 times the risk of 1&#8201;year MACCE in patients with DM (22.3% vs 7.1% in the non-OSA group; adjusted HR (HR)=2.49, 95% CI 1.16 to 5.35, p=0.019), but not in patients without DM (8.5% vs 7.7% in the non-OSA group, adjusted HR=0.94, 95%&#8201;CI 0.51 to 1.75, p=0.85).

Right ventricular wall tension was estimated according to Laplace's law as right ventricle length&#8201;&#215;&#8201;tricuspid regurgitation peak gradient and it was correlated with right ventricle haemodynamic profile; its potential prognostic impact was tested along with canonical right ventricle function parameters. Right ventricular wall tension correlated significantly with invasive estimation of right ventricle end-diastolic pressure (R: 0.343, p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001) and with several other haemodynamic variables, such as mean pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary artery compliance, transpulmonary gradient, pulmonary vascular resistance, right atrial pressure and right ventricle stroke work index (all p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001).

Radiographic findings suggested cervical spondylosis with a vertical atlantoaxial subluxation. Following 20 sessions of chiropractic treatment, the patient experienced complete relief from neck problems and difficulty in swallowing. Rhythmic swallowing movements are controlled by a central pattern-generating circuit of the brain stem. In this case, the brain stem could have been compressed by the odontoid process of the axis due to C1/2 instability. Cervicogenic dysphagia is a cervical cause of difficulty in swallowing. Cervical complaints in the context of dysphagia are mostly under-estimated. A high degree of clinical suspicion is pivotal in timely intervention.",

Infarct size and neurological de&#64257;cits were measured at 48 hrs after stroke. Neurological de&#64257;cits were assessed using Bederson's scoring system and tape removal test. Blood T cell flow cytometry was performed to measure the differentiation of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Western blot was used to detect the protein levels of inflammation-related molecules, apoptosis-related molecule, and signaling molecules in ischemic brain. TUNEL staining was performed to analyze cell apoptosis in ischemic cerebral cortex.\nThe transplantation of lymphocytes co-cultured with HCB-SCs significantly improved the neurological defects, reduced ischemic brain damage, and increased the proportion of peripheral CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs. Meanwhile, the transplantation of co-cultured cells decreased the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome and associated factors, such as caspase-1 and IL-1&#946;, and inhibited the activation of NF-&#954;B, ERK and caspase-3 in ischemic brain. The co-cultured cells significantly decreased the number of tMCAO-induced cell apoptosis.\nLymphocytes co-cultured with HCB-SCs exhibit a neuroprotective effect after ischemic stroke by promoting Tregs differentiation and suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome activation and neuron apoptosis, and might be a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.",

        "abstract": "\nRNA-binding proteins like human antigen R (HuR) are key regulators in post-transcriptional control of gene expression in several pathophysiological conditions. Diabetes adversely affects monocyte/macrophage biology and function. It is not known whether diabetic milieu affects cellular/exosome-HuR and its implications on cardiac inflammation and fibrosis. Here, we evaluate in vitro and in vivo effects of diabetic milieu on macrophage cellular/exosome-HuR, alterations in intercellular cross talk with fibroblasts, and its impact on cardiac remodeling. Human failing hearts show higher HuR levels. Diabetic milieu activates HuR expression in cardiac- and cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM&#216;) and stimulates HuR nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation and exosome transfer. Exosomes from macrophages exposed to diabetic milieu (high glucose or db/db mice) significantly increase inflammatory and profibrogenic responses in fibroblast (in vitro) and cardiac fibrosis in mice. Intriguingly, Exo-HuR deficiency (HuR knockdown in macrophage) abrogates the above effects. In diabetic mice, macrophage depletion followed by reconstitution with BMM&#216;-derived HuR-deficient exosomes inhibits angiotensin II-induced cardiac fibrosis response and preserves left ventricle function as compared to control-exosome administration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that diabetes activates BMM&#216; HuR expression and its transfer into exosome. The data suggest that HuR might be targeted to alleviate macrophage dysfunction and pathological fibrosis in diabetes.",

Preoperative and postoperative hematoma volumes and reduction in midline shifts were calculated and recorded. The preoperative and postoperative (initial, discharge, and 180th day after stroke onset) neurological status was assessed by Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, respectively. <strong>RESULTS</strong> The range of hematoma volumes of surgical patients was 24-99 ml (median, 50 ml). The median time of CT scan (from the time of the request to navigation finish) was 11 min. Total and near-total (>90%) hematoma evacuation was achieved in 96.9% cases. Compared with the initial state of neurological assessment, there was a significant improvement in MRS and GCS at discharge (P<0.001). After 6 months, 57.1% of patients had achieved functional recovery (GOS 4-5) and 2 patients had died. <strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong> As a minimally invasive technique, image-guided transcortical sulci or transsylvian approach is highly effective for immediate and complete hematoma evacuation.",

        "abstract": "\nNeuroinflammation is implicated in a host of neurological insults, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy. The immune response to central nervous system (CNS) injury involves sequelae including the release of numerous cytokines and chemokines. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), is one such cytokine that is elevated following CNS injury, and is associated with the prognosis of TBI, and ischemic stroke. MIF has been identified in astrocytes and neurons, and some of the trophic actions of MIF have been related to its direct and indirect actions on astrocytes. However, the potential modulation of CNS neuronal function by MIF has not yet been explored. This study tests the hypothesis that MIF can directly influence hippocampal neuronal function. MIF was microinjected into the hippocampus and the genetically encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP6f, was used to measure Ca2+ events in acute adult mouse brain hippocampal slices. Results demonstrated that a single injection of 200 ng MIF into the hippocampus significantly increased baseline calcium signals in CA1 pyramidal neuron somata, and altered calcium responses to N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) + D-serine in pyramidal cell apical dendrites located in the stratum radiatum. These data are the first to show direct effects of MIF on hippocampal neurons and on NMDA receptor function. Considering that MIF is elevated after brain insults such as TBI, the data suggest that, in addition to the previously described role of MIF in astrocyte reactivity, elevated MIF can have significant effects on neuronal function in the hippocampus.",

However, the vast majority of studies elucidating the role of alcohol in cardiovascular and in the global burden of disease relies on epidemiological studies of associative nature which carry several limitations. This is why the cardiovascular benefits of low-moderate alcohol consumption are being questioned and perhaps might have been overestimated. Thus, the aim of this review was to critically discuss the current knowledge on the relationship between alcohol intake and cardiovascular disease. Besides new evidence associating low and moderate alcohol consumption with decreased risk of cardiovascular disease, several questions remain unanswered related to the concrete amount of safe consumption, the type of alcoholic beverage, and the age-, sex-, and genetic/ethnical-specific differences in alcohol consumption.",

We conducted a retrospective observational study of patients who visited a stroke clinic between January 2011 and March 2017. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) MRI studies were obtained at baseline and follow-up visits to identify new infarctions and CMB progression. Patients with CMB who also underwent brain computed tomography (CT) imaging were identified and their cerebral arterial calcification was quantified to evaluate the relationship between the extent of intracranial calcification and CMB burden. A total of 64 stroke patients (mean age 73.1 &#177; 11.0, 47% males) had CMB on baseline and follow-up MRI studies. During a mean follow-up period of 22.6 months, four strokes occurred (4/64, 6%; 3 ischemic, 1 hemorrhagic), producing mild neurological deficit. Progression of CMB was observed in 54% of patients with two MRIs and was significantly associated with length of follow-up. Subjects with intracranial calcification score > 300 cm3 had higher CMB count than those with scores <300 cm3 at both baseline (12.6 &#177; 11.7 vs. 4.9 &#177; 2.2, p = 0.02) and follow-up (14.1 &#177; 11.8 vs. 5.6 &#177; 2.4, p = 0.03) MRI evaluations.

Dabigatran is a relatively new drug, and as a result, its interactions with other medications and their significance are not fully known. A 72 years old male, having a medical history of heart and renal failure, was hospitalized for pneumonia treatment. The patient was taking several drugs, including dabigatran 150 mg twice daily and ranolazine 750 mg twice daily. His creatinine clearance was 45.22 mL/min, International Normalized Ratio (INR)-7.03. Dabigatran was discontinued. After 9 days, INR decreased to 1.33, and after 6 days, creatinine clearance increased to 64.39 mL/min. The patient was taking an adequate dosage of dabigatran, thus dabigatran was thought to be overdosed due to its interaction with ranolazine because dabigatran is a p-glycoprotein substrate, whereas ranolazine is the inhibitor of this transporter. Dabigatran and ranolazine should be used with caution in patients with renal failure. It is recommended to use smaller doses of both medications and observe coagulation parameters if needed.",

Some evidence showed that exposure to these metals increased plasma homocysteine levels.\nA systematic review was carried out to clarify the relationship between homocysteine blood levels and exposure to toxic heavy metals (Lead, Cadmium, Mercury, and Chromium).\nThe results of this systematic review indicate that exposure to Pb, Cr, Cd, and Hg is connected with nonphysiological homocysteine levels or vitamin B12 and folate serum concentrations.\nThese findings reinforce the importance of involvement in exposure to heavy metals in homocysteine metabolism.

We aimed to replicate this finding in a first-ever stroke patient cohort. Hp was genotyped by PCR and gel electrophoresis in the Helsinki Stroke Aging Memory Study in patients with DNA and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) available (SAM; n = 316). Lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions (WML) classified by Fazekas grading from brain MRI were associated with Hp genotypes.

Here, we present an approach to examine the capillary-to-arteriole signaling in an ex vivo hippocampal capillary-parenchymal arteriole (HiCaPA) preparation from mouse brain. We describe how to isolate, cannulate, and pressurize the microcirculation to measure arteriolar diameter in response to capillary stimulation. We show which appropriate functional controls can be used to validate the HiCaPA preparation integrity and display typical results, including testing potassium as a neurovascular coupling agent and the effect of the recently characterized inhibitor of the Kir2 inward rectifying potassium channel family, ML133. Further, we compare the responses in preparations obtained from male and female mice. While these data reflect functional investigations, our approach can also be used in molecular biology, immunochemistry, and electrophysiology studies.",

It is hypothesised that VNS delivered during rehabilitation will improve upper limb function compared to control rehabilitation therapy. Two pilot clinical studies demonstrated acceptable safety and feasibility of VNS paired with rehabilitation for improved upper limb function after stroke. Participants who received rehabilitation paired with VNS demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in motor function that exceed gains seen among controls who received similar rehabilitation without VNS. These preliminary data support a larger pivotal trial.\nVNS-REHAB (VNS-Rehabilitation) is a pivotal, multi-site, double-blinded, randomised trial designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of VNS paired with upper limb rehabilitation after ischaemic stroke. The study will include up to 120 participants with upper limb weakness due to stroke nine months to 10 years prior. All participants will be implanted with a VNS device and randomised to receive either Active (0.8 mA) or Control VNS (0.0 mA) paired with upper limb rehabilitation. All participants receive 18 sessions of in-clinic therapy for six weeks, followed by a home-based therapy for three months. The rehabilitation therapy involves progressive, functionally based and intensive practice of hand and arm tasks. VNS is delivered during each movement repetition. After blinded follow-up is completed, the Active vagus nerve stimulation group continues with home-based Active VNS and the Control group receive six weeks of in-clinic therapy with Active VNS followed by home-based Active VNS. The primary efficacy endpoint will be the difference in Fugl-Meyer assessment-upper extremity scores between the Active VNS and Control VNS groups at the end of six weeks of in-clinic therapy. Additional secondary endpoints will also be measured. Safety will be assessed with analysis of adverse events and device complications during study participation.\nThis pivotal trial will determine whether VNS paired with rehabilitation is a safe and effective treatment for improving arm function after stroke.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03131960.

First, we analysed a panel of 30 candidate genes associated with arterial dissection (any site) or aneurysm according to the OMIM (online Mendelian Inheritance of Men) database. Second, we performed a genome-wide search for pathogenic variants causing other vascular phenotypes possibly related to cervical artery dissection.Findings were classified as CeAD-causing (pathogenic variants in genes from the arterial dissection or aneurysm panel) or suggestive (pathogenic variants in genes associated with other vascular phenotypes and variants of unknown significance in genes from the arterial dissection or aneurysm panel). All other variants were classified as benign/uncertain.\nAmong 43 CeAD-patients, 28 patients (17 pedigrees) had f-CeAD and 15 had r-CeAD. No CeAD-causing variants were identified in r-CeAD patients. Among f-CeAD-patients, 5/17 pedigrees carried CeAD-causing variants in COL3A1, COL4A1, COL4A3, COL4A4, COL5A1, COL5A2 and FBN1. Suggestive variants in ABCC6, COL3A1, COL5A2, MEF2A, and RNF213 were detected in three pedigrees with f-CeAD and six patients with r-CeAD.Discussion and conclusion: CeAD-causing variants were rare and exclusively found in f-CeAD-patients, suggesting differences between the genetic architectures of f-CeAD and r-CeAD.

We assessed the availability of stroke care plans in Europe, and evaluated their impact on rates of reperfusion therapies for stroke.\nBased on the European Stroke Organisation (ESO), the European Society of Minimally Invasive Neurological Therapy (ESMINT), the European Academy of Neurology (EAN), and the Stroke Alliance for Europe (SAFE) survey, we analysed specific prespecified items in the questionnaire regarding availability and adequacy of stroke care plans, organised prehospital care and their potential impact on rates of delivery of reperfusion therapies for stroke at the country level.\nOf 44 participating European countries, 37 have stroke care plans that operate at national and/or regional levels. Most stroke care plans take responsibility for the organisation/implementation of stroke systems of care (86%), quality of care assessment (77%), and act as a liaison between emergency medical systems and stroke physicians (79%). As for stroke systems of care, the focus is mainly on prehospital and in-hospital acute stroke care (Code Stroke systems available in 37/44 countries). Preferred urgent transport is via non-medicalised ambulances (70%). Presence of stroke care plans, stroke registry data, transport of urgent stroke patients via non-medicalised ambulances, and drip-and-ship routing of acute patients showed higher reperfusion treatment rates.\nAvailability of stroke care plans, still absent in some European countries, as well as some features of the stroke systems of care are associated with higher reperfusion treatment rates.\nStroke is not yet a priority everywhere in Europe, which is a barrier to the spread of reperfusion therapies for stroke.",

In this second Pneumonia in Stroke ConsEnsuS statement, we propose a standardised approach to empirical antibiotic therapy in pneumonia complicating stroke, based on likely microbiological aetiology, to improve antibiotic stewardship.\nSystematic literature searches of multiple databases were undertaken. An evidence review and a round of consensus consultation were completed prior to a final multi-disciplinary consensus meeting in September 2017, held in Barcelona, Spain. Consensus was approached using a modified Delphi technique and defined a priori as 75% agreement between the consensus group members.Findings: No randomised trials to guide antibiotic treatment of pneumonia complicating stroke were identified. Consensus was reached for the following: (1) Stroke-associated pneumonia may be caused by organisms associated with either community-acquired or hospital-acquired pneumonia; (2) Treatment for early stroke-associated pneumonia (<72 h of stroke onset) should cover community-acquired pneumonia organisms; (3) Treatment for late stroke-associated pneumonia (&#8805;72 h and within seven days of stroke onset) should cover community-acquired pneumonia organisms plus coliforms +/- Pseudomonas spp. if risk factors; (4) No additional antimicrobial cover is required for patients with dysphagia or aspiration; (5) Pneumonia occurring after seven days from stroke onset should be treated as for hospital-acquired pneumonia; (6) Treatment should continue for at least seven days for each of these scenarios.\nConsensus recommendations for antibiotic treatment of the spectrum of pneumonia complicating stroke are proposed. However, there was limited evidence available to formulate consensus on choice of specific antibiotic class for pneumonia complicating stroke.\nFurther studies are required to inform evidence-based treatment of stroke-associated pneumonia including randomised trials of antibiotics and validation of candidate biomarkers.",

        "abstract": "\nThe purpose of the European Stroke Organisation-Karolinska Stroke Update Conference is to provide updates on recent stroke therapy research and to give an opportunity for the participants to discuss how these results may be implemented into clinical routine. The meeting started 22 years ago as Karolinska Stroke Update, but since 2014 it is a joint conference with European Stroke Organisation. Importantly, it provides a platform for discussion on the European Stroke Organisation guidelines process and on recommendations to the European Stroke Organisation guidelines committee on specific topics. By this, it adds a direct influence from stroke professionals otherwise not involved in committees and work groups on the guideline procedure. The discussions at the conference may also inspire new guidelines when motivated. The topics raised at the meeting are selected by the scientific programme committee mainly based on recent important scientific publications. This year's European Stroke Organisation-Karolinska Stroke Update Meeting was held in Stockholm on 11-13 November 2018. There were 11 scientific sessions discussed in the meeting including two short sessions. Each session except the short sessions produced a consensus statement (Full version with background, issues, conclusions and references are published as web-material and at www.eso-karolinska.org and http://eso-stroke.org) and recommendations which were prepared by a writing committee consisting of session chair(s), scientific secretary and speakers. These statements were presented to the 250 participants of the meeting. In the open meeting, general participants commented on the consensus statement and recommendations and the final document were adjusted based on the discussion from the general participants Recommendations (grade of evidence) were graded according to the 1998 Karolinska Stroke Update meeting with regard to the strength of evidence. Grade A Evidence: Strong support from randomised controlled trials and statistical reviews (at least one randomised controlled trial plus one statistical review). Grade B Evidence: Support from randomised controlled trials and statistical reviews (one randomised controlled trial or one statistical review). Grade C Evidence: No reasonable support from randomised controlled trials, recommendations based on small randomised and/or non-randomised controlled trials evidence.",

The guideline was prepared following the Standard Operational Procedure for a European Stroke Organisation guideline document and according to GRADE methodology. As a basic principle, we defined use of oral anticoagulation pragmatically: oral anticoagulation use is assumed by positive medical history unless relevant anticoagulant activity is regarded unlikely by medical history or has been ruled out by laboratory testing. Overall, we strongly recommend using prothrombin complex over no treatment and fresh-frozen plasma in patients on VKA plus vitamin K. We further strongly recommend using idarucizumab in patients on dabigatran and make a recommendation for andexanet alfa in patients on rivaroxaban and apixaban over no treatment. We make a weak recommendation on using high-dose prothrombin complex concentrate (50 IU/kg) for all patients taking edoxaban and for patients on rivaroxaban or apixaban in case andexanet alfa is not available. We recommend against using tranexamic acid and rFVIIa, outside of trials. The presented treatment recommendations aim to normalise coagulation, there is no or only indirect data on effects on functional outcome or mortality, and only little data from randomised controlled trials.",

There is a growing body of evidence that the omission of aspirin from TT has the same preventive efficacy in terms of major adverse cardiacvascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) with significantly lower bleeding events.

Search terms included \"infective endocarditis\", \"history of\", \"trend\", \"epidemiology\", \"outcome\", \"medical management\", \"surgery\", \"indication\", and \"re-operative surgery\", or any combination thereof. The United States has the highest incidence of IE in the world at 15 per 100,000 people, with increases in incidence due to the aging population as well as increasing rates of intravenous drug use (IVDU). National guidelines support early surgical intervention in specific clinical settings in both left and right-sided IE. However, only 11% of the evidence used in formulating guidelines for surgical therapy in IE are based on level A evidence. Ongoing controversies include whether to perform surgery in the setting of continued or recurrent IVDU in a patient with a prior valve operation, timing of surgery after acute stroke due to IE, and general indications for surgery for tricuspid valve IE. IE has a surging incidence and increasing burden on the healthcare system in the United States. Multiple controversies exist, and formulating level A evidence and multidisciplinary collaboration will be essential components to effectively treating this complex patient population.",

To investigate the robustness of non-invasive multimodality cardiac imaging in rabbits using clinical-grade CT and MR scanners.\nA total of 16 rabbits (2.7-4.0 kg) serially underwent cardiac-gated imaging using a clinical-grade 256-row CT and a 1.5 Tesla MR-scanner at baseline and at 4-month follow-up (16&#177;1 weeks). Image analysis included image quality (5-grade scale), left ventricular (LV) volumes, LV stroke volume, LV diameters, LV wall thickness and ejection fraction (LVEF).\nCardiac MR (CMR) and CT angiography (CTA) provide images with an overall good image quality (excellent or good quality: CMR 82% vs. CTA 78%, P=0.68). Linear regression analysis demonstrated a good correlation of all diameters (diam.) and volumes (vol.) as assessed by CTA and CMR (diam.: r=0.9, 95% CI: 0.8-0.9; vol.: r=0.8, 95% CI: 0.6-0.9; P<0.0001 for both). CTA-based volumetric analysis revealed slightly higher LVEF values as compared to CMR (CTA: 64%&#177;1%, CMR: 59%&#177;1%, P=0.002).

Recent findings suggest that long-term outcomes are improved in early-revascularized NSTEMI patients. However, it has been stated that early surgery is associated to increased operative risk. In this study, we wanted to elucidate if early CABG in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome can be performed safely.\nWe performed a monocentric-prospective observational study within a 2-year interval. A total of 217 consecutive patients (41 female, age 68.9&#177;10.2, ES II 6.62&#177;8.56) developed NSTEMI and underwent CABG. Patients were divided into two groups according to the time point of coronary artery bypass after symptom onset (group A: <72 h; group B: >72 h). Endpoints included 6-month mortality and incidence of MACE (death, stroke or re-infarction).\nThere were no differences regarding mortality between both groups (30 days: group A 2.4% vs. group B 3.7%; P=0.592; 6 months: 8.4% vs. 6.0%; P=0.487).

Decision analytic models to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of systemic anticoagulation in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients, focusing on the benefit in quality-adjusted life years, may be helpful in clarifying this uncertainty. We constructed a 31-state Markov decision analytic model to explore anticoagulation and no anticoagulation strategies. Modeled patient characteristics included gender, use of central catheter-based pulmonary arterial hypertension therapy, type of pulmonary arterial hypertension (idiopathic, idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, or connective-tissue associated, connective tissue disease-pulmonary arterial hypertension), and use of oral contraceptive medication by females. Modeled events included mortality, thromboembolic complications, atrial fibrillation, stroke, and anticoagulation bleeding. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Anticoagulation was favored in all idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension cases, with a gain of 0.43-0.51 quality-adjusted life years, and detrimental in all connective tissue disease-pulmonary arterial hypertension cases, with a loss of 0.66-1.89 quality-adjusted life years. Anticoagulation would need to demonstrate a hazard ratio for pulmonary arterial hypertension mortality of 0.95 or better to be favored. In our model, idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension patients benefit from anticoagulation in terms of quality-adjusted life years, and connective tissue disease-pulmonary arterial hypertension patients were harmed, with a hazard ratio for pulmonary arterial hypertension mortality of 0.95 or better being required to favorably impact quality-adjusted life years. These results suggest that anticoagulation significantly improves quality adjusted life years and should be offered to all idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension patients. Shared decision models based on these results may help clarify therapeutic decision-making uncertainty in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients.",

These lesions are a potential underrecognized cause of cryptogenic ischemic stroke. Although the recognition of carotid webs has increased, no evidence-based treatment guidelines are available. We surveyed subspecialists across multiple neurologic disciplines to assess the state of current clinical practice. Methods: An 8-question multiple-choice style survey of neurologists and radiologists assessed familiarity with this disease entity, preferred imaging modalities, and management strategies for asymptomatic and symptomatic (producing stroke) carotid webs. Responses were collected through SurveyMonkey software via anonymous responses to a posted survey link on the Society of Neurointerventional Surgery website in addition to invitation emails sent to colleagues in corresponding fields. Results: Of the 74 total respondents, 64% identified as neurointerventionalists. Respondents identified computed tomography angiography as the most commonly used imaging modality to place carotid webs in the differential diagnosis (57% of respondents' preference), while conventional digital subtraction angiogram was the preferred modality to confirm a web (54% of respondents' preference). Respondents preferred single and dual antiplatelet therapy to manage asymptomatic and acute stroke-producing carotid webs, while invasive treatment was most commonly sought for webs producing recurrent strokes. Conclusion: Familiarity with carotid webs varied across subspecialties. We found some consensus among respondents on the imaging modality preferred to identify webs, on asymptomatic carotid web management, and on recurrently symptomatic (multiple strokes) carotid web management. Less consistency was seen regarding preferences for confirmatory imaging and management of acutely symptomatic (initial stroke) carotid webs.",

These metabolites play important roles in physiology and pathogenesis of host defense mechanisms, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, inflammatory, allergic and neurodegenerative diseases. The 12/15-lipoxygenase (LOX) is special in that it can directly oxidize lipid membranes containing polyunsaturated fatty acids, without the preceding action of a phospholipase, leading to the direct attack on membranous organelles, such as mitochondria. The cytotoxic activity of human 12/15-LOX is up-regulated in neurons and endothelial cells especially after a stroke and thought to contribute to both neuronal cell death and blood-brain barrier leakage. The discovery of inhibitors that selectively target recombinant 12/15-LOX in vitro, as well as possessing activity against the murine orthologous ex vivo, could potentially support a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of stroke and other brain disorders related to 12/15-LOX.

However, no US population-based systems exist to estimate pregnancy frequency or complications among women with CHDs. Cases were identified in multiple data sources from 3 surveillance sites: Emory University (EU) whose catchment area included 5 metropolitan Atlanta counties; Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MA) whose catchment area was statewide; and New York State Department of Health (NY) whose catchment area included 11 counties. Cases were categorized into one of 5 mutually exclusive CHD severity groups collapsed to severe versus not severe; specific ICD-9-CM codes were used to capture pregnancy, gestational complications, and nongestational co-morbidities in women, age 11 to 50 years, with a CHD-related ICD-9-CM code. Pregnancy, CHD severity, demographics, gestational complications, co-morbidities, and insurance status were evaluated. ICD-9-CM codes identified 26,655 women with CHDs, of whom 5,672 (21.3%, range: 12.8% in NY to 22.5% in MA) had codes indicating a pregnancy. Over 3 years, age-adjusted proportion pregnancy rates among women with severe CHDs ranged from 10.0% to 24.6%, and 14.2% to 21.7% for women with nonsevere CHDs. Pregnant women with CHDs of any severity, compared with nonpregnant women with CHDs, reported more noncardiovascular co-morbidities. Insurance type varied by site and pregnancy status. These US population-based, multisite estimates of pregnancy among women with CHD indicate a substantial number of women with CHDs may be experiencing pregnancy and complications. In conclusion, given the growing adult population with CHDs, reproductive health of women with CHD is an important public health issue.",

Age was negatively associated with PTSD symptoms with only trend-level significance (3 months: OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.83, p = 0.087; 6 months: OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.70, p = 0.015; 12 months: OR&#8201;=&#8201;0.88, p&#8201;=&#8201; 0.087).

Pre-morbid functioning, initial stroke prognosis, total number of complications, and length of hospital/ICU stay were not associated with PTSD symptoms; however, each was significantly correlated with poorer functional outcomes. Yet, poorer functional outcomes were observed in those with higher reports of PTSD symptoms (r&#8201;=&#8201;0.24, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.01).\nFunctional outcomes in ICH are correlated with PTSD symptoms, however the mechanism and relationship are difficult to elucidate.

        "abstract": "\nIntracranial artery dissection (IAD) is an underdiagnosed, non-atherosclerotic cause of stroke with various clinical manifestations. To identify all the potential studies investigating the epidemiology, risk factors, symptoms, radiology findings, and treatment methods of IAD, we conducted a literature search screening PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and BIREME. According to the results of several studies, IAD is the major cause of ischemic stroke in at least one-third of the cervical-cranial artery dissection (CCAD) cases presenting with ischemic stroke. Mechanical causes are associated with cervical artery dissections (CAD) in up to 40 % of the cases. However, the risk factors for IAD are still not completely understood. Antithrombotic therapy with either antiplatelet or classic anticoagulants is the mainstay of treatment for preventing further thromboembolic complication after a stroke. Endovascular or surgical treatment options can be considered when medical therapies are not effective or when there is a high rate of recurrence or increased risk of bleeding. The observational studies have shown that these methods are very effective in preventing recurrence and significantly improving morbidity and mortality in patients with ruptured dissections. Clinical trials are required to establish the best option for each mechanism of ischemic lesion.",

        "title": "Action observation as a treatment option for fear avoidance behavior in chronic spinal pain.",
        "abstract": "\nPsychological factors play an essential role in the maintenance of various chronic pain states, with fear avoidance beliefs contributing to significant functional limitation and disability in chronic spinal pain. Fear avoidance behaviors are typically managed with cognitive-behavioral interventions such as graded exposure to feared movements and graded activity programs. However, attempts to make patients with high pain-related fear perform painful actions using graded exposure therapy can be very challenging. These fear avoidance beliefs in individuals with pain are usually acquired through previous pain experiences, observation, and threating verbal input from others that movement is harmful to the spinal structures. Observational learning of fear has been recently demonstrated in several experimental studies, where participants acquired fear of pain after observing the distressed painful expressions of the volunteers performing a painful cold pressor task. The primary purpose of this paper is to propose action observation, a cognitive rehabilitation technique, as one of the treatment options for reducing fear avoidance behavior in chronic spinal pain. Action observation involves the visualization of others performing a movement or an action to influence motor behavior positively and is mainly used in stroke rehabilitation. The paper hypothesizes that the pain-related fear of movement may be reduced through observation of others performing threatening movements successfully without displaying pain or discomfort. Action observation of others successfully executing a strenuous task may break the preexisting cognitive association between movement and pain among patients with high pain-related fear. Other possible mechanisms through which observation may influence pain-related fear could be the activation of mirror neuron systems and subsequent modulation of nociceptive information through the interconnections between the amygdala (one of the brain centers for fear), descending pain modulatory system and higher cortical centers. Few initial studies that investigated the effects of action observation on other outcomes of pain, such as pain severity are described to review the hypothesis. Considering the influence of observational learning on pain-related fear, action observation may be explored as potential adjunctive treatment to reduce fear avoidance behavior in chronic spinal pain.",

The present study aimed to explore demographic and clinical predictors of post stroke depression and determine discriminative cognitive, motor, and functional factors in stroke patients with and without depression.\nIn a cross sectional study, 100 patients with stroke were investigated. Measurements consisted of Beck Depression Inventory-II, Trail Making Test A & B, Digit Span Subtest of Wechsler Memory Scale, Motricity Index (arm and leg motor), Trunk Control Test, Barthel Index, and Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. Demographics and clinical data including educational level, marital status, limb affected, cigarette smoking habits, diabetes mellitus, cardiac diseases, and blood pressure were also collected.\nMultivariate logistic regression revealed that college level of education (OR&#8201;=&#8201;8.78, 95% CI: 2.65-29.11, P&#8201;<&#8201;0.001) and cardiac diseases (OR&#8201;=&#8201;3.11, 95% CI: 1.19-8.13, P&#8201;<&#8201;0.001) were significant demographic and clinical predictors of post stroke depression. Using stepwise discriminant function analysis, basic activities of daily living and trunk control with 88.0% classification accuracy, 81.1% sensitivity, and 95.7% specificity were as the best discriminators of post stroke depression.\nRehabilitation experts working with patients with stroke should pay special attention to trunk control and basic activities of daily living for preventing consequences of PSD particularly in those with higher educational level and cardiac diseases.",

        "abstract": "\nOver the past several decades, important advances have been made in the treatment of patients with heart failure (HF). Whereas in the past, the main goal of drug therapy was to relieve congestion, there is now compelling evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) showing that several classes of drugs, most of which work predominantly by blocking or modulating neurohormonal activity, can substantially reduce morbidity and mortality as well as improve quality of life in patients with HF. Most of these trials, however, separated patients according to whether their ejection fraction (EF) was reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) and for the most part, favorable effects on clinical outcomes were demonstrated only in patients with HFrEF. In addition to the paucity of effective agents for managing patients with HFpEF, it has become apparent that underutilization of available therapies has greatly limited the overall impact of medical therapy on outcomes. This review provides an overview of current medical management of HF across the spectrum of EF, including the underutilization of treatment modalities. The focus is to provide clinicians the rationale for the use of specific agents and to present a practical approach for patient management. The strategies discussed are based on results of RCTs, guideline recommendations and the authors' own experience in managing patients with HF over the years.",

        "abstract": "\nTranscarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) has become an increasingly popular alternative for the treatment of carotid bifurcation stenosis. TCAR employs carotid blood flow reversal through an ex&#160;vivo common carotid artery to femoral vein shunt for neuroprotection during the placement and angioplasty of the carotid artery stent. There is a lack of data regarding an association between the duration of flow reversal and neurologic complications or other adverse events. We analyzed TCAR flow reversal time in relation to major adverse events.\nThere were 307 patients who underwent TCAR at four high-volume academic institutions. Patients were separated on the basis of the duration of carotid flow reversal as follows: group I, &#8804;8&#160;minutes (n&#160;= 138); group II, 9-13&#160;minutes (n&#160;= 105); group III, 14-20&#160;minutes (n&#160;= 42); and group IV, >20&#160;minutes (n&#160;= 22). Adverse events including stroke (assessed by a National Institute of Health Stroke Scale-certified examiner), myocardial infarction (MI), and death at discharge and 30&#160;days were collected in all patients and were compared between groups using one-way analysis of variance and &#967;2 analysis.\nThere were four strokes in the total cohort, yielding an overall stroke rate of 1.3%. All strokes were minor in nature; two were ipsilateral and two were contralateral. All patients demonstrated full recovery at 30&#160;days. We found no significant difference in the stroke rate between any of the groups: I, 1.5% (2/138); II, 1.9% (2/105); III, 0% (0/42); and IV, 0% (0/22; P&#160;= .76). The four strokes occurred in patients with flow reversal time of 6, 7, 11, and 12&#160;minutes. There was also no difference in the 30-day composite stroke/death or stroke/death/MI rates among the groups.\nThe length of flow reversal during TCAR does not affect rates of stroke, MI, or death. These data suggest that operators should focus on the technical aspects of the procedure during flow reversal rather than on its duration.",

However, the cardioprotective effect of light and moderate alcohol consumption has been recently questioned. In the absence of a randomized trial confirming the cardioprotective effect of light or moderate alcohol consumption, an alternative method to prove the causality is Mendelian randomization using a genetic variant serving as a proxy for alcohol consumption. A Mendelian randomization analysis by Holmes et al. suggests that a reduction in alcohol intake is beneficial for cardiovascular health also in light to moderate drinkers. In a recent analysis of 83 prospective studies, alcohol consumption was roughly linearly associated with a higher risk of stroke, coronary heart disease excluding myocardial infarction, heart failure and risk of death from aortic aneurysm dissection. By contrast, increased alcohol consumption was associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction. \"Low-risk\" alcohol consumption recommended by the National Institute of Public Health, Czech Republic, should not exceed 16 g of 100% ethanol/day for women and 24 g/day for men; at least two days a week should be alcohol free, and the dose of ethanol during binge drinking should not exceed 40 g. In practice, this means one standard drink daily for five days at most and two standard drinks at most when binge drinking.

Over the last few decades, a significant paradigm shift has occurred away from open microsurgical clipping toward endovascular coil embolization. Multiple studies have been performed with mixed results. Some studies suggest that endovascular treatment produces better clinical and functional outcomes, but is associated with increased need for retreatment. Other studies report increased durability in aneurysms treated with microsurgical clipping, but that clipping may be associated with worse functional outcomes in some cases. Further complicating the dialogue are variable costs associated with different treatment modalities, including country-dependent cost differences. Here we provide a review of some of the major studies comparing open surgery versus endovascular treatment for both RIAs and UIAs to distill their key findings and corresponding implications for clinical practice. We relate these research results to our institution's experience with RIAs and UIAs and describe our approach to treatment of these conditions. Finally, we discuss implications of the paradigm shift for both open and endovascular surgery, including educational initiatives directed toward preserving important microsurgical tenets in the setting of diminishing surgical volume.",

Approaches for assessment included SAH grade, Garcia test, brain water content evaluation, rotarod test, Morris water maze test, Western blot, immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. The results showed that wnt-3a improved the neurological scores, brain water content and long-term neurobehavioral functions after SAH. Wnt-3a increased the level of Frz-1, aldolase C, &#946;-catenin, PPAN and the Bcl-2/Bax ratio; and decreased the level of axin and cleaved caspase-3 (CC-3). The anti-apoptotic effect of wnt-3a was further evidenced by TUNEL staining and subcellular structure imaging. Frz-1 siRNA and aldolase C siRNA offset the effects of wnt-3a; and restoration of aldolase C by aldolase C CRISPR in Frz-1 siRNA preconditioned SAH rats salvaged the level of Frz-1, aldolase C, PPAN and reduced axin and CC-3. In summary, intranasal administration of wnt-3a alleviates neuronal apoptosis through Frz-1/aldolase C/PPAN pathway in the EBI of SAH rats. The feasible intranasal route and the long-lasting neuroprotective property of wnt-3a is of great clinical relevance.",

Patients with NOAF were identified and their CHA2DS2-VASc score was calculated. The authors evaluated the association of CHA2DS2-VASc score and its individual components with in-hospital mortality in these patients. A total of 640 (1.7% [38,708 patients]; 95% CI 1.5%-1.8%) patients developed NOAF during the study period. The in-hospital mortality rate in patients included in the analysis was 14.3%. There was no association between in-hospital mortality and CHA2DS2VASc score. However, the likelihood of in-hospital death was 1.56&#8239; times&#8239;greater for patients having atrial fibrillation and concomitant vascular disease (95% CI 1.003-2.429; p&#8239;=&#8239;0.049).\nNew-onset atrial fibrillation is common in critically ill patients and is associated with high in-hospital mortality. The authors found that the CHA2DS2-VASc score itself is not a reliable prognostic marker of in-hospital mortality in these patients. However, the presence of vascular disease in patients with NOAF may increase the mortality associated with this disease.",

The review was undertaken according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (number: CRD42018094607). Multiple electronic databases were searched to identify relevant articles. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed. The primary outcome measures were early mortality and re-intervention, late all cause and aorta related mortality, and re-intervention. Meta-analysis was used to produce pooled odds ratios (OR) or risk difference (RD) for peri-operative outcomes. Random effects models were applied. For late outcomes a time to event meta-analysis was conducted using the inverse variance model, reporting the results as hazard ratios (HR).\nEight original articles from six studies encompassing 14&#160;706 patients (1 066 TEVARs) were eligible for inclusion. There were no statistically significant differences between TEVAR and BMT with regards to inpatient mortality (RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01-0.02, p&#160;=&#160;.46), early re-intervention by TEVAR (RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.01-0.04, p&#160;=&#160;.19) or surgery (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.01-0.01, p&#160;=&#160;1.0). BMT was associated with a significantly lower risk of early stroke (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.48-0.85, p&#160;=&#160;.002), whereas the risk of late all cause (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.27-1.86, p&#160;<&#160;.001) and aorta related mortality (HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.49-4.94, p&#160;=&#160;.001) was significantly higher than with TEVAR. No suitable data regarding late aortic re-intervention was found for meta-analysis.\nGiven the limited number and quality of suitable studies it remains uncertain whether TEVAR is beneficial in the management of acute/subacute uTBAD.

Self-efficacy for managing chronic disease may impact sleep for SAH survivors; however, little is known about the relationship between self-efficacy and subjective and objective sleep measures. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations among self-efficacy and subjective (nighttime sleep quality and daytime sleepiness) and objective (total sleep time [TST], wake after sleep onset [WASO], and sleep efficiency [SE]) sleep measures in SAH survivors. A cross-sectional study with a convenience sample of 30 SAH survivors was conducted. Self-efficacy was assessed with the Self-Efficacy for Managing Chronic Disease scale. Nighttime sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, respectively. SAH survivors wore a wrist actigraph for 7&#160;days to estimate TST, WASO, and SE. Analyses revealed that, within 3&#160;months post-SAH, 73% of SAH survivors experienced poor sleep quality and 27% reported excessive daytime sleepiness. In addition, 41.4% of the participants slept on average either <&#160;7&#160;h or >&#160;9&#160;h. Self-efficacy was correlated with nighttime sleep quality (r&#160;=&#160;-0.394, p&#160;=&#160;.031) and SE (r&#160;=&#160;0.412, p&#160;=&#160;.026), but not with daytime sleepiness (r&#160;=&#160;-0.257, p&#160;=&#160;.170), TST (r&#160;=&#160;0.137, p&#160;=&#160;.447), or WASO (r&#160;=&#160;-0.223, p&#160;=&#160;.246).

There is a compelling need to identify modifiable factors that influence compliance rates, so that these factors can be addressed as targets of quality improvement. This study examines the relationship between cardiovascular provider experience and compliance with performance measures for outpatients with coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure, and atrial fibrillation in the PINNACLE Registry. We hypothesize that providers who have been practicing longer, especially those further out from certification who may not be required to recertify, will have lower compliance rates with key cardiac performance measures. Using clinical data from January 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014 in the PINNACLE Registry, we employed a multilevel hierarchical logistic regression analysis to examine the relationship between cardiac performance measures and provider experience, defined by the number of years since initial cardiology board certification (<10 years vs 10 to 20 years vs &#8805;20 years). We found a significant difference in compliance in 4 out of 9 outpatient cardiac performance measures between providers with different experience levels. Providers with &#8805;20 years since certification were less compliant with 3 out of the 4 statistically different performance metrics; however, the absolute difference between performance measures by provider experience level was small. In conclusion, performance on several key cardiovascular quality measures demonstrate a statistically significant negative association with physician experience-level defined by years since initial cardiology certification, but the clinical significance of this finding is unclear.",

Additionally, an increased risk of ischemia per a 1&#8239;&#215;&#8239;109/L increase in WBC at baseline was observed at 30 days (Adjusted HR 1.07, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.12, p&#8239;=&#8239;0.002) and at 1 year (Adjusted HR 1.05 95% CI 1.02 to 1.08, p&#8239;=&#8239;0.001 at 1 year). In conclusion, a higher WBC count at baseline was associated with an increased risk of the composite bleeding endpoint by 30 days but not at 1 year. The association between WBC count and the risk of the composite ischemic endpoint was significant at 30 days and 1 year.",

        "abstract": "\nThe impact of body mass index (BMI) on cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering therapy is uncertain. We performed meta-analysis of 29 randomized controlled trials using PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL through April 2019. Therapies were grouped as more intensive LDL-C lowering therapy (statins, ezetimibe&#8239;+&#8239;statin or PCSK9 inhibitors) and less intensive LDL-C lowering therapy (less potent active control or placebo). Random effects meta-regressions and meta-analyses were performed to evaluate association of BMI with cardiovascular endpoints. In 265,766 patients, for every 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI, more intensive therapy compared with less intensive therapy was associated with hazard ratio (HR) of 1.07 for cardiovascular mortality (95% confidence interval 1.02 to 1.13); HR of 1.03 for all-cause mortality (0.99 to 1.06) HR of 1.06 for myocardial infarction (1.02 to 1.09), HR of 1.08 (1.03 to 1.12) for revascularization and HR of 1.04 for MACE (1.01 to 1.07). Meta-analysis showed that patients with BMI <25 kg/m2 had the highest risk reduction in mortality and cardiovascular outcomes compared with patients with BMI &#8805;30 kg/m2 (p-interaction &#8804;0.05). In conclusion, patients with normal BMI treated with intensive LDL-C lowering regimens may derive a larger clinical benefit compared with patients with larger BMI. The results could be due to the higher mortality rate of obese patients that may artificially lower the efficacy of therapy, or due to a true therapeutic limitation in these patients.",

Nevertheless, the prognostic value of serum UA level in hospitalized heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has not been fully elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum UA level on admission could be associated with subsequent mortality in hospitalized patients with HFpEF. We examined 516 consecutive hospitalized HFpEF (left ventricular ejection fraction &#8805;50%) patients with decompensated heart failure from our HFpEF-specific multicenter registry who had serum UA data on admission. The primary outcome of interest was all-cause death. During a median follow-up period of 749 (interquartile range 540 to 831) days, 90 (17%) patients died. Higher serum UA level was significantly related to increased incidence of all-cause death (p&#8239;=&#8239;0.016). In addition, patients with higher serum UA (&#8805;6.6 mg/dl, median) and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (&#8805;401.2 pg/ml, median) levels had the highest incidence of all-cause death in the groups (p&#8239;=&#8239;0.002). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, serum UA was an independent determinant of mortality (hazards ratio 1.23, 95% confidence interval 1.10 to 1.39) even after adjustment for prespecified confounders, renal function and the use of diuretics before admission. In conclusions, higher admission serum UA was an independent determinant of mortality in hospitalized HFpEF patients. Our findings indicate the importance of assessing admission serum UA level for further risk stratification in hospitalized patients with HFpEF.",

        "abstract": "\nStroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) is a spectrum of pulmonary infections in non-mechanical ventilation patients within 7 days of stroke. SAP is one of the most common complications after stroke, with an incidence of 7%-38%, which is significantly associated with poor prognosis of stroke. Stroke-induced immune-depression syndrome (SIDS) is one of the main pathogenesis of SAP, which is closely related to autoimmune, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenalin axis (HPA axis), parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), and damage-related molecular patterns (DAMPs). It is unclear how the lungs and brain interact during the development of SAP. Some clinical studies have found that some clinical indicators such as monocyte human leukocyte antigen-DR (mHLA-DR), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and heart rate variability (HRV) can be used to predict SAP occurrence. Old age, male, and diabetes are currently considered risk factors for SAP. Furthermore, a variety of SAP risk scales such as A2DS2 scale (age, atrial fibrillation, dysphagia, gender and stroke severity), preventive antibacterial therapy in acute ischemic stroke (PANTHERIS) scale, acute ischemic stroke-associated pneumonia scale (AIS-APS), and ISAN scale (pre-stroke independence, gender, age, and stroke severity) have been developed. According to the opinion of Pneumonia in Stroke Consensus in 2015, it is recommended to use the modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) pneumonia clinical diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of SAP. Prevention of SAP is the most important part of clinical practice. Preventive antibiotics are not recommended, and once SAP is diagnosed, the antibiotic strategies should be followed. Neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory treatments are still being studied.",

The patients were divided into IAPP-CPR group and S-CPR group according to whether the patients had IAPP-CPR indication or not. The patients in the S-CPR group were operated according to the 2015 American Heart Association (AHA) CPR guidelines; and the patients in the IAPP-CPR group received the IAPP-CPR on the basis of the S-CRP. During the relaxation period, the patients were subjected to abdominal lifting and compressing with amplitude of 4-5 cm, frequency of 100-120 times/min, and the time ratio of lifting to compressing was 1:1. Hemodynamic changes during resuscitation were recorded in the two groups. Hemodynamics, oxygen metabolism, arterial blood gas analysis and prognostic indicators were recorded at 30 minutes after successful resuscitation.\nDuring the study period, 77 patients were selected, 24 patients were excluded from giving up treatment and quitting, 53 patients were enrolled in the analysis finally, with 28 patients in the S-CPR group and 25 in the IAPP-CPR group. (1) The heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) showed an upward trend during resuscitation, and a more significant increase was shown in the IAPP-CPR group. (2) Hemodynamics after successful resuscitation: there were 16 patients with successful resuscitation in the IAPP-CPR group and 13 in the S-CPR group. The MAP, CPP, global ejection fraction (GEF) and stroke volume (SV) of patients with successful resuscitation at 30 minutes after resuscitation in the IAPP-CPR group were significantly higher than those in the S-CPR group [MAP mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa): 52.88&#177;3.11 vs. 39.39&#177;4.62, CPP (mmHg): 36.56&#177;6.89 vs. 29.61&#177;6.92, GEF: 0.217&#177;0.036 vs. 0.178&#177;0.027, SV (mL): 38.43&#177;5.25 vs. 32.92&#177;8.28, all P < 0.05], but there was no significant difference in central venous pressure (CVP) or HR between the two groups. (3) Oxygen metabolism after successful resuscitation: the cardiac output (CO), arterial oxygen content (CaO2), oxygen transport (DO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2) of patients with successful resuscitation at 30 minutes after resuscitation in the IAPP-CPR group were significantly higher than those in the S-CPR group [CO (L/min): 2.23&#177;0.38 vs. 1.99&#177;0.29, CaO2 (mL/L): 158.0&#177;11.8 vs. 141.4&#177;8.2, DO2 (mL/L): 245.8&#177;29.9 vs. 209.1&#177;28.0, VO2 (mL/L): 138.2&#177;24.9 vs. 112.8&#177;18.1, all P < 0.05].

(5) The patients in the IAPP-CPR group had a shorter time for cardiac arrest to restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) than that in the S-CPR group (minutes: 10.63&#177;2.94 vs. 14.54&#177;3.84, P < 0.01), and the rate of ROSC, CPR successful rate and 28-day survival rate were significantly higher than those in the S-CPR group [64.0% (16/25) vs. 46.4% (13/28), 60.0% (15/25) vs. 28.6% (8/28), 52.0% (13/25) vs. 21.4% (6/28), all P < 0.05].

The sepsis model was produced by CLP, and the rats in the normal control group were only anesthetized and resuscitated. The general situation after modeling in each group was observed, and the left ventricular function was assessed by high-resolution echocardiography at all the time points. The abdominal aorta blood of rats was collected, and the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), interleukin-1&#946; (IL-1&#946;) and MB isoenzyme of creatine kinase (CK-MB) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The myocardial tissue was harvested, and the pathological changes in myocardial tissue were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining.\nThe rats challenged to CLP displayed symptoms of sepsis, such as depression, ruffled fur, decreased diet and activity, and the symptoms became more obvious with the extension of time. High-resolution echocardiography could clearly show the structure of left ventricle in each group and obtain satisfactory M-mode echocardiography of left ventricle. The heart rate (HR) of rats in all sepsis groups was elevated with the increase in model time as measured by high-resolution ultrasound, and it was significantly higher than that in the normal control group at 12, 24, 30 hours (bpm: 359.66&#177;23.33, 361.35&#177;12.85, 392.67&#177;11.33 vs. 306.24&#177;29.79, all P < 0.05). Stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) in sepsis rats were decreased with the increase in model time, while left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) were increased first and then decreased, and SV and LVEF in sepsis 48 hours group were significantly lower than those in the normal control group [SV (&#956;L): 78.43&#177;17.52 vs. 122.61&#177;15.88, LVEF: 0.763&#177;0.018 vs. 0.902&#177;0.011, both P < 0.05]. Left ventricular weight (LVW) in all sepsis groups was increased to different degrees as compared with that in the normal control group, as well as the left ventricular anterior and posterior wall thickness increased in diastole and systole. Compared with the normal control group, the left ventricular posterior wall thickness was increased significantly at the end of diastolic and systolic period in the sepsis 12 hours group, and the left ventricular anterior wall thickness was also increased significantly at the end of diastolic period in the sepsis 48 hours group. The serum levels of TNF-&#945;, IL-1&#946; and CK-MB in sepsis rats were increased first and then decreased with the extension of model making time. The above parameters in the sepsis 48 hours group were still significantly higher than those in the normal control group [TNF-&#945; (ng/L): 61.59&#177;3.99 vs. 16.87&#177;4.89, IL-1&#946; (ng/L): 255.03&#177;13.23 vs. 119.59&#177;10.43, CK-MB (&#956;g/L): 1.27&#177;0.15 vs. 0.52&#177;0.15, all P < 0.05]. HE staining showed that the myocardial striations of the rats in the normal control group were clear and complete, with normal morphology and orderly arrangement of cardiac cells. However in the sepsis groups, myocardial cells were swollen, ruptured and necrotic, and inflammatory cells were infiltrated, with myocardial fibers ruptured and necrosis dissolved, and the above pathological manifestations gradually increased with the extension of the model making time.\nHigh-resolution ultrasound can evaluate the cardiac function of CLP induced sepsis rat model more comprehensive, and the consequence of evaluation index is consistent with the expression level of myocardial enzyme and histopathologic manifestations.",

        "abstract": "\nA common challenge in the development of laboratory clinical decision support (CDS) and laboratory utilization management (UM) initiatives stems from the fact that many laboratory tests have multiple potential indications, limiting the ability to develop context-specific alerts. As a potential solution, we designed a CDS alert that asks the ordering clinician to provide the indication for testing, using D-dimer as an exemplar. Using data collected over a nearly 3-year period, we sought to determine whether the indication capture was a useful feature within the CDS alert and whether it provided actionable intelligence to guide the development of an UM strategy.\nWe extracted results and ordering data for D-dimer testing performed in our laboratory over a 35-month period. We analyzed order patterns by clinical indication, hospital service, and length of hospitalization.\nOur final data set included 13,971 result-order combinations and indeed provided actionable intelligence regarding test utilization patterns. For example, pulmonary embolism was the most common emergency department indication (86%), while disseminated intravascular coagulation was the most common inpatient indication (56%). D-dimer positivity rates increased with the duration of hospitalization and our data suggested limited utility for ordering this test in the setting of suspected venous thromboembolic disease in admitted patients. In addition, we found that D-dimer was ordered for unexpected indications including the assessment of stroke, dissection, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\nIndication capture within a CDS alert and correlation with result data can provide insight into order patterns which can be used to develop future CDS strategies to guide appropriate test use by clinical indication.",

The primary outcome was off-label DOAC dosing frequency, defined as dosing inconsistent with manufacturer labeling. Secondary outcomes included variables associated with off-label dosing and a composite of adverse events (major bleeding, thromboembolism, and all-cause mortality) in the 90 days following the index hospital discharge.\nOf 249 included patients, 16.1% were discharged with off-label dosing. Factors associated with off-label dosing included advanced age, lower body mass index, decreased renal function, use of rivaroxaban, and hepatic impairment. The majority of off-label patients (70%) received lower-than-recommended DOAC dosing. Prescriber rationale for off-label prescribing was documented in 25% of patients and included anti-Xa guided dosing, high risk for bleeding or thromboembolism, and prior history of on-therapy adverse events. The rate of adverse events between labeled and off-label DOAC doses was not statistically different (10.0% vs. 6.7%, p=0.299), although this is likely due to small sample size.\nOff-label DOAC prescribing for stroke prevention in NVAF at University of Utah Health was consistent or lower than previously published studies. Off-label dosing most often involved under-dosing of rivaroxaban. Future research should investigate the role of provider rationale and insight in optimizing DOAC therapy outcomes.",

        "abstract": "\nExpression and short-term prognostic value of miR-126 and miR-182 in patients with acute stroke were investigated. In total, 153 patients with acute stroke admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from February 2016 to February 2018 were enrolled into the observation group as group A [88 patients with acute cerebral infarction (AIS)] or group B [65 patients with cerebral hemorrhage (ICH)]. Furthermore, 69 healthy people receiving physical examinations in the hospital were enrolled into the control group. The relative expression of miR-126 and miR-182 in all subjects were measured and their correlation with the National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) and activities of daily living (ADL) scores was analyzed. After 3 months of follow-up, the correlation of miR-126 and miR-182 with the Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) score of patients was investigated. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was employed to explore the value of miR-126 and miR-182, alone or in combination, in predicting the prognosis of acute stroke patients. Subjects in the control group had markedly higher miR-126 expression and lower miR-182 expression than those in group A and group B in the observation group (P<0.05). Pearson's correlation analysis suggested a notable correlation of miR-126 and miR-182 with NIHSS and ADL scores. Patients with a mild condition or good prognosis had higher miR-126 expression and lower miR-182 expression than patients with a severe condition or poor prognosis (P<0.05). Both miR-126 and miR-182 predicted the prognosis of acute stroke, and the combination of miR-126 and miR-182 presented better accuracy. The expression levels of miR-126 and miR-182 are associated with the neurological function, self-care ability, and prognosis in patients with acute stroke is highly valuable for predicting the prognosis of patients.",

Few studies have looked into the comprehensive picture of post stroke depression in past.\nThe current study aimed to look into the phenomenology, characteristic features and various correlates of post stroke depression.\n142 consecutive stroke patients aged 60 years or above, fulfilling the inclusion criteria were assessed. Sociodemographic and clinical data were gathered using a specially designed pro-forma. Depression, apathy and psychosis were assessed by Post stroke depression rating scale, Apathy Evaluation Scale, and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale respectively. Groups (with or without major depression) were compared using Mann-Whitney U, chi square or Fisher's exact test. One way ANOVA was conducted to see the relations of lesion location and laterality with various clinical parameters. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was done to see the time to develop depression. The effect sizes were reported as r and partial eta squared.\nGuilt was significantly higher (p<.05) with lesions in parietal lobe and remaining of middle cerebral artery territory. Catastrophic reaction (p<.05) and emotional dyscontrol (p<.05) were higher for diffuse lesions, periventricular lesions and lesions in frontal/occipital lobe. BPRS score, but not apathy, had a significant positive correlation with depression (Pearson's r=.692). Mean time to develop depression after stroke was 28.34 (95% CI 22.37 to 34.31) months.\nPost stroke depression consists of various clinically important sub-components whose occurrence varies with different lesion locations. Post stroke depression is discriminable from apathy but is related to psychosis.",

The goal of this study is to determine the occurrence and manifestations of myocarditis in a heart failure (HF) population. The analyzed patients had acute or persistent HF and were referred over a 6-year period to a quaternary HF center for advanced HF therapies including mechanical circulatory support, left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation, and/or heart transplantation. The histopathological diagnosis of myocarditis was made based on the presence of an inflammatory infiltrate of the myocardium, typically with associated cardiomyocyte (CMC) damage, combined as indicated with immunohistochemical and molecular biology characterization. The pathological findings were correlated with a panel of clinical parameters and clinical course of the patients. Myocarditis was identified in 36 patients, with initial diagnoses made in 10 (40%) of 25 by endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), 1 by atrial biopsy (maze procedure), 7 (2.1%) of 331&#160;at LVAD implantation, and 18 (7.8%) of 229 in the explanted heart. There were 20 cases of lymphocytic myocarditis, 4 cases of giant cell myocarditis, 3 cases of eosinophilic myocarditis, and 9 cases of lymphohistocytic with granulomas myocarditis - cardiac sarcoidosis. EMB was performed in 25 patients and was positive in 10 (40%) of cases. Myocarditis was found in 23 explanted hearts including 18 cases de novo and 5 cases with a previously positive specimen. Of the 23 explanted hearts, 21 were nonischemic cardiomyopathy and 2 were ischemic cardiomyopathy. Our findings show that, in patients presenting to a quaternary medical center, myocarditis can be manifest as acute HF as well as a complicating factor in chronic HF.",

Animal models are necessary to uncover disease processes and develop novel therapies. When attempting to model these or other neurologic diseases, the accompanying anesthesia and analgesia create variables that are not part of the onset of the clinical disease in the human population but are critical components of the postinjury care both in humans and animals. To maximize model validity, researchers must consider whether the disease process or a novel therapy is being studied. Damage to the neurons of the brain or the spinal cord is not painful at the neural tissue itself, but alterations to nociceptive signaling along the pain pathway can induce chronic pain. In addition, trauma or surgery leading to the event is associated with damage to peripheral tissue. Inflammation is inextricably associated with tissue injury. Inflammation is known to evoke nociception in the periphery and drive long-term changes to neurons in the CNS. Analgesics and anesthetics alter these responses yet are required as part of humane animal care. Careful planning for effective drug administration consistent with the standard of care for humans and equivalent animal care is required.",

We sought to determine whether prior GIB in patients with AF taking anticoagulants was associated with an increased risk of stroke or major hemorrhage.\nWe analyzed key efficacy and safety outcomes in patients with prior GIB in ARISTOTLE. Centrally adjudicated outcomes according to GIB history were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for randomized treatment and established risk factors.\nA total of 784 (4.3%) patients had prior GIB events (321 [41%] lower, 463 [59%] upper); 215 (27%) occurred <1 year before study enrollment. Patients with prior GIB were older, had more comorbidities, and higher CHADS2 and HAS-BLED scores than those with no GIB. Major GIB occurred more frequently in those with prior GIB (lower: aHR 1.72, 95% CI 0.86-3.42; upper: aHR 3.13, 95% CI 1.97-4.96). This association with major GIB was more pronounced in patients with GIB <1 year before randomization versus no recent GIB (recent lower: aHR 2.58, 95% CI 0.95-7.01; recent upper: aHR 5.16, 95% CI 2.66-10.0). There was no association between prior GIB and risk of stroke/systemic embolism or all-cause death. In those with prior GIB, the apixaban versus warfarin relative risks for stroke/systemic embolism, hemorrhagic stroke, death, or major bleeding were consistent with the results of the overall trial.\nIn patients with AF on oral anticoagulants, prior GIB was associated with an increased risk of subsequent major GIB but not stroke, intracranial bleeding, or all-cause mortality.

        "abstract": "\nBackground and Purpose- Observational data suggest that antiplatelet therapy after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) alleviates thromboembolic risk without increasing the risk of recurrent ICH. Given the paucity of data on the relationship between antiplatelet therapy after ICH and functional outcomes, we aimed to study this association in a multicenter cohort. Methods- We meta-analyzed data from (1) the Massachusetts General Hospital ICH registry (n=1854), (2) the Virtual International Stroke Trials Archive database (n=762), and (3) the Yale stroke registry (n=185). Our exposure was antiplatelet therapy after ICH, which was modeled as a time-varying covariate. Our primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and a composite of major disability or death (modified Rankin Scale score 4-6). We used Cox proportional regression analyses to estimate the hazard ratio of death or poor functional outcome as a function of antiplatelet therapy and random-effects meta-analysis to pool the estimated HRs across studies. Additional analyses stratified by hematoma location (lobar and deep ICH) were performed. Results- We included a total of 2801 ICH patients, of whom 288 (10.3%) were started on antiplatelet medications after ICH. Median times to antiplatelet therapy ranged from 7 to 39 days. Antiplatelet therapy after ICH was not associated with mortality (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.66-1.09), or death or major disability (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.59-1.16) compared with patients not started on antiplatelet therapy. Similar results were obtained in additional analyses stratified by hematoma location. Conclusions- Antiplatelet therapy after ICH appeared safe and was not associated with all-cause mortality or functional outcome, regardless of hematoma location. Randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the effects and harms of antiplatelet therapy after ICH.",

Upper limb function is essential for daily life and reduction in movements can lead to tremendous decline in quality of life and independence. Current treatments, such as physiotherapy, aim to improve motor functions, however due to increasing NHS pressure, growing recognition on mental health, and close scrutiny on disease spending there is an urgent need for new approaches to be developed rapidly and sufficient resources devoted to stroke disease. Fortunately, a range of digital technologies has led to revived rehabilitation techniques in captivating and stimulating environments. To gain further insight, a meta-analysis literature search was carried out using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. Articles were categorized and pooled into the following groups; pro/anti/neutral for the use of digital technology. Additionally, most literature is rationalised by quantitative and qualitative findings. Findings displayed, the majority of the inclusive literature is supportive of the use of digital technologies in the rehabilitation of upper extremity following stroke. Overall, the review highlights a wide understanding and promise directed into introducing devices into a clinical setting. Analysis of all four categories; (1) Digital Technology, (2) Virtual Reality, (3) Robotics and (4) Leap Motion displayed varying qualities both-pro and negative across each device. Prevailing developments on use of these technologies highlights an evolutionary and revolutionary step into utilizing digital technologies for rehabilitation purposes due to the vast functional gains and engagement levels experienced by patients.

        "abstract": "\nStructural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to characterise the appearance of the brain in cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), ischaemic stroke, cognitive impairment, and dementia. SVD is a major cause of stroke and dementia; features of SVD include white matter hyperintensities (WMH) of presumed vascular origin, lacunes of presumed vascular origin, microbleeds, and perivascular spaces. Cognitive impairment and dementia have traditionally been stratified into subtypes of varying origin, e.g., vascular dementia versus dementia of the Alzheimer's type (Alzheimer's disease; AD). Vascular dementia is caused by reduced blood flow in the brain, often as a result of SVD, and AD is thought to have its genesis in the accumulation of tau and amyloid-beta leading to brain atrophy. But after early seminal studies in the 1990s found neurovascular disease features in around 30% of AD patients, it is becoming recognised that so-called \"mixed pathologies\" (of vascular and neurodegenerative origin) exist in many more patients diagnosed with stroke, only one type of dementia, or cognitive impairment. On the back of these discoveries, attempts have recently been made to quantify the full extent of degenerative and vascular disease in the brain in vivo on MRI. The hope being that these \"global\" methods may one day lead to better diagnoses of disease and provide more sensitive measurements to detect treatment effects in clinical trials. Indeed, the \"Total MRI burden of cerebral small vessel disease\", the \"Brain Health Index\" (BHI), and \"MRI measure of degenerative and cerebrovascular pathology in Alzheimer disease\" have all been shown to have stronger associations with clinical and cognitive phenotypes than individual brain MRI features. This chapter will review individual structural brain MRI features commonly seen in SVD, stroke, and dementia. The relationship between these features and differing clinical and cognitive phenotypes will be discussed along with developments in their measurement and quantification. The chapter will go on to review emerging methods for quantifying the collective burden of structural brain MRI findings and how these \"whole picture\" methods may lead to better diagnoses of neurovascular and neurodegenerative disorders.",

An integrated approach was developed to identify significantly dysregulated LncMRTs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of IS and these dysregulated LncMRT networks exhibited specific topological characteristics and a closer network structure than the global LncMRT network that was constructed. The variation of the risk score for LncMRTs indicated that there were multiple dysregulated patterns of LncMRTs in IS. Numerous core clusters were identified from dysregulated LncMRT networks and these core clusters could distinguish IS patient and matched control samples. Finally, functional analyses demonstrated that LncMRTs associated with IS participated in the regulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3&#8209;kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathway. In conclusion, the roles of the LncMRTs in IS were elucidated, which could be beneficial for understanding IS pathogenesis and treatment.",

        "abstract": "\nAtyplase is a kind of thrombolytic drug with strong fibrin specificity. It can promote the synthesis of fibrinolytic enzymes by combining fibrin and plasminogen in thrombus, and then dissolve thrombus. Ateplase intravenous thrombolysis is the only effective method for stroke treatment proved by evidence-based medicine. The aim of this study was to observe the effect of different doses of ateplase on acute ischemic stroke. They were randomly divided into control group (n=43) and observation group (n=43). The patients in the control group were treated with low-dose alteplase, while those in the observation group were treated with standard-dose alteplase. The control group was treated with 0.6 mg/kg ateplase intravenous thrombolysis, and the observation group was treated with 0.9mg/kg ateplase. The GCS scores on the 1 day was 14.06&#177;1.57 in the control group after treatment, and 13.84&#177;2.48 in the observation group. The NIHSS score was 4.59&#177;1.12 in the control group, and 7.13&#177;1.05 in the observation group. Intravenous thrombolytic therapy with intravenous thrombolytic therapy is effective and safe in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. At the same time, there were no persistent adverse reactions after treatment, mainly in gingival bleeding, epistaxis, intracranial hemorrhage, gastrointestinal bleeding, and hematuria and so on. The results showed that different doses of alteplase could improve neurological function and living ability of patients. Future studies need to broaden the sample size to study the safety of low and standard doses of alteplase in patients with acute cerebral infarction.",

This unique capability is advantageous for imaging fragile biological samples but its highest possible imaging rate is far lower than the level desired in biological studies. Here, we present the development of high-speed SICM. The fast imaging capability is attained by a fast Z-scanner with active vibration control and pipette probes with enhanced ion conductance. By the former, the delay of probe Z-positioning is minimized to sub-10 &#181;s, while its maximum stroke is secured at 6 &#956;m. The enhanced ion conductance lowers a noise floor in ion current detection, increasing the detection bandwidth up to 100 kHz. Thus, temporal resolution 100-fold higher than that of conventional systems is achieved, together with spatial resolution around 20 nm.",

Sulfur emission regulations also affect particulate matter emissions due to fuel change. Particulate matter (PM) emitted from low-speed, two-stroke, large-power diesel engine were studied in test-bed experiments. Experiments were conducted at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% load with heavy fuel oil (HFO, 3.36%m/m&#160;S) and a lighter marine diesel oil (MDO, 0.1%m/m&#160;S). The experiments revealed that using MDO could decrease the mass emission factors (EFs) of PM compared to HFO due to the fuel quality and content; however, there was no obvious difference for the number EFs of PM. The main particle when using HFO consists sulfates and bound water, and the hydrate sulfur increased with the increased engine loads. Then, another 21% is organic carbon (OC). Emission factors for inorganic elements were also studied in particles from combustion of HFO and MDO. The EFs of OC and elemental carbon (EC) were affected by engine loads, fuel type, fuel sulfur content (FSC), and combustion conditions. The size distribution of OC was similar to EC, and there were two clearly peaks for every particulate matter sample. The key effect factor for EFs of PM with marine fossil fuels was FSC.",

We report the case of a 36-year-old Caucasian female with a history of craniopharyngioma treated with whole-brain radiotherapy 20 years previously. She was admitted to the emergency department with disorientation and imperceptible speech lasting for 1 hour. Upon examination, she had slight motor aphasia, without sensory or motor deficits. However, the neurological deficits worsened on standing position. The computed tomography (CT) angiogram and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography revealed occlusion of the distal portion of the left internal carotid artery (ICA). Mechanical thrombectomy was attempted without success. Head CT was repeated, revealing left periventricular acute ischaemic stroke. The cerebral angiography showed total occlusion of the left ICA with an exuberant network of transdural collateral vessels, confirming MMS. The patient completed a functional rehabilitation program with progressive improvement of deficits and maintained a multidisciplinary follow-up. MMS is a serious late complication from cranial radiation therapy and a well-described risk factor for ischaemic stroke in younger patients. Therefore, early detection and prompt treatment are mandatory, as the consequences can be disastrous, such as cognitive and neurologic decline due to repeated strokes.\nMoyamoya syndrome should be considered in younger patients presenting with acute neurologic deficits, particularly those treated with cranial radiotherapy.The treatment of acute stroke in patients with moyamoya syndrome should include intravenous hydration and avoidance of hypotension.The benefit of antiplatelet agents is limited and equivocal for patients with moyamoya syndrome and oral anticoagulants are not recommended for long-term treatment.",

We report a case of cardiac tamponade during the treatment of CCI associated with atrial fibrillation.\nA 72-year-old man presented with loss of consciousness after chest discomfort. He had taken rivaroxaban for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Twelve-lead electrocardiography showed ST elevation at II, III, and aVF. His National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 29. We diagnosed him with synchronous cardioembolic stroke and acute myocardial infarction due to atrial fibrillation. The coronary angiography revealed distal occlusion in the posterior descending branch of the right coronary artery, and overall myocardial perfusion seemed sufficient. The diffusion-weighted image showed hyperintense lesions at the cerebellum, and magnetic resonance angiography did not reveal the flow of the basilar artery. The patient's NIH score improved immediately, so we did not perform intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) administration nor endovascular treatment. Heparin administration was started. After 38 h from the onset, he suffered from hydrocephalus, and cerebral ventricular drainage was performed. Subsequently, circulatory dynamics worsened, and he was diagnosed with cardiac tamponade. Emergency pericardiotomy was performed, and he has been taking intensive care.\nSome cases with CCI treated with IV-tPA and endovascular intervention were reported, but the treatment strategy should be still discussed multidisciplinary.

Twenty adults with upper limb activity limitations who had some movement in the upper limb completed an extra hour of upper limb practice, 6 days per week for 4 weeks. Feasibility was measured by examining recruitment, intervention (adherence, efficiency, acceptability, safety) and measurement. Clinical outcomes were upper limb activity (Box and Block Test, Nine-Hole Peg Test) and grip strength (dynamometry) measured at baseline (week 0) and end of intervention (week 4).\nOf the 212 people who were screened, 42 (20%) were eligible and 20 (9%) were enrolled. Of the 20 participants, 12 (60%) completed the 4-week program; 7 (35%) were discharged early, and 1 (5%) withdrew. Participants attended 342 (85%) of the possible 403 sessions and practiced for 324 (95%) of the total 342 h. In terms of safety, there were no study-related adverse events.

Samples were randomly distributed into four groups based on the pretreatment done and each group contains 20 samples, group I-(control), group II-(silanization), group III-(sandblasting), and group IV-(thermal treatment of silane). After surface treatment, exposed post surface was uniformly coated with dual-cured resin cement. Cement was cured for 40 seconds with a halogen lamp. The samples are subjected to load in a universal testing machine (UTM) at a crosshead speed of 1.0 mm/minutes to evaluate the bonding failure at the interface.\nGroup IV resulted in the highest bond strength values followed by group III. Group II showed a comparatively higher value than group I but less than groups III and IV.\nSurface treatment procedure, on fiber post by silanization and sandblasting significantly improved adhesion between post and luting cement interface.\nThe surface pretreatment, such as sandblasting, silanization, thermal activation of silane coupling agents significantly improved, the retention of the post within in the root canal system.

A recent proof-of-principle study, based on a small group of hospitalised patients with acute ischemic stroke, suggested that iTBS applied to the ipsilesional M1 combined with physical therapy early after stroke can amplify motor recovery with lasting after effects. A randomised controlled clinical trial using a double-blind design is warranted to justify the implementation of iTBS-assisted motor rehabilitation in neurorehabilitation from an acute ischaemic stroke.\nWe investigate the effects of daily iTBS on early motor rehabilitation after stroke in an investigator-initiated, longitudinal randomised controlled trial. Patients (n=150) with hemiparesis receive either iTBS (600 pulses) applied to the ipsilesional motor cortex (M1) or a control stimulation (ie, coil placement over the parieto-occipital vertex in parallel to the interhemispheric fissure and with a tilt of 45&#176;). On 8 consecutive workdays, a 45&#8201;min arm-centred motor training follows the intervention . The relative grip strength, defined as the grip force ratios of the affected and unaffected hands, serves as the primary outcome parameter. Secondary outcome parameters are measures of arm function (Action Research Arm Test, Fugl-Meyer Motor Scale), stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale), stroke-induced disability (modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index), duration of inpatient rehabilitation, quality of life (EuroQol 5D), motor evoked potentials and the resting motor threshold of the ipsilesional M1.\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Commission of the Medical Faculty, University of Cologne, Germany (reference number 15-343).

        "abstract": "\nVaricella zoster virus (VZV) can spread anterogradely and infect cerebral arteries causing VZV vasculopathy and arterial ischemic stroke. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that virus-infected cerebrovascular fibroblasts undergo phenotypic changes that promote vascular remodeling and facilitate virus transmission in an in vitro model of VZV vasculopathy. The aims of this project were therefore to examine the changes that virus-infected human brain adventitial vascular fibroblasts (HBVAFs) undergo in an in vitro model of VZV vasculopathy and to identify disease biomarkers relating to VZV-related vasculopathy.\nHBVAFs were infected with VZV, and their ability to migrate, proliferate, transdifferentiate, and interact with endothelial cells was studied with flow cytometry. Microparticles (MPs) released from these cells were isolated and imaged with transmission electron microscopy, and their protein content was analyzed with mass spectrometry. Circulating MP profiles were also studied in children with VZV and non-VZV vasculopathy and compared with controls.\nVZV-infected HBVAFs transdifferentiated into myofibroblasts with enhanced proliferative and migratory capacity. Interaction of VZV-infected HBVAFs with endothelial cells resulted in endothelial dysfunction. These effects were, in part, mediated by the release of MPs from VZV-infected HBVAFs. These MPs contained VZV virions that could transmit VZV to neighboring cells, highlighting a novel model of VZV cell-to-cell viral dissemination. MPs positive for VZV were significantly higher in children with VZV-related vasculopathy compared to children with non-VZV vasculopathy (p = 0.01) and controls (p = 0.007).\nVZV-infected HBVAFs promote vascular remodeling and facilitate virus transmission. These effects were mediated by the release of apoptotic MPs that could transmit VZV infection to neighboring cells through a Trojan horse means of productive viral infection. VZV+ MPs may represent a disease biomarker worthy of further study.",

Participants were presented with 24 sentences with neutral semantic content spoken with happy, sad, angry, afraid, surprised, or bored prosody and chose which emotion the speaker was feeling based on tone of voice. Multivariable linear regression was used to identify individual predictors of emotional prosody identification accuracy from a model, including percent damage to proposed right hemisphere structures, age, education, and lesion volume across all emotions (overall emotion identification) and 6 individual emotions. Patterns of recovery were also examined at the chronic stage.\nThe overall emotion identification model was significant (adjusted r 2 = 0.52; p = 0.043); greater damage to right posterior STG (p = 0.038) and older age (p = 0.009) were individual predictors of impairment. The model for recognition of fear was also significant (adjusted r 2 = 0.77; p = 0.002), with greater damage to right amygdala (p = 0.047), older age (p < 0.001), and less education (p = 0.005) as individual predictors. Over half of patients with chronic stroke had residual impairments.\nRight posterior STG in the right hemisphere ventral stream is critical for emotion identification in speech.

        "abstract": "\nMicroglial activation plays a central role in poststroke inflammation and causes secondary neuronal damage; however, it also contributes in debris clearance and chronic recovery. Microglial pro- and antiinflammatory responses (or so-called M1-M2 phenotypes) coexist and antagonize each other throughout the disease progress. As a result of this balance, poststroke immune responses alter stroke outcomes. Our previous study found microglial expression of interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) and IRF4 was related to pro- and antiinflammatory responses, respectively. In the present study, we genetically modified the IRF5 and IRF4 signaling to explore their roles in stroke. Both in vitro and in vivo assays were utilized; IRF5 or IRF4 small interfering RNA (siRNA), lentivirus, and conditional knockout (CKO) techniques were employed to modulate IRF5 or IRF4 expression in microglia. We used a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model to induce stroke and examined both acute and chronic stroke outcomes. Poststroke inflammation was evaluated with flow cytometry, RT-PCR, MultiPlex, and immunofluorescence staining. An oscillating pattern of the IRF5-IRF4 regulatory axis function was revealed. Down-regulation of IRF5 signaling by siRNA or CKO resulted in increased IRF4 expression, enhanced M2 activation, quenched proinflammatory responses, and improved stroke outcomes, whereas down-regulation of IRF4 led to increased IRF5 expression, enhanced M1 activation, exacerbated proinflammatory responses, and worse functional recovery. Up-regulation of IRF4 or IRF5 by lentivirus induced similar results. We conclude that the IRF5-IRF4 regulatory axis is a key determinant in microglial activation. The IRF5-IRF4 regulatory axis is a potential therapeutic target for neuroinflammation and ischemic stroke.",

This study sought to investigate the optimal perfusion strategy for pediatric DCD hearts by using a juvenile porcine model comparing pressure- vs flow-targeted strategy.\nThe hearts of the juvenile DCD pigs were explanted, and the coronary arteries were perfused for 2 hours by the ex vivo heart perfusion system with 2 different perfusion strategies; pressure-targeted perfusion (target coronary perfusion pressure: 40 mm Hg, group A) and flow-targeted perfusion (target coronary perfusion flow: 10 ml/kg/min, group B). The working model heart perfusion was used to assess systolic and diastolic myocardial performance.\nThe body weight, warm and cold ischemic time, and ex vivo perfusion time were comparable between the groups.

This may be partly due to differences in task paradigm, patient heterogeneity, and methods of fMRI analysis. We conducted a meta-analysis using an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) method to identify regions of differential brain activation in patients with mTBI compared to healthy controls. We included experiments that performed scans from acute to subacute time points post-injury. The seven included studies recruited a total sample of 174 patients with mTBIs and 139 control participants. The results of our coordinate based meta-analysis revealed a single cluster of reduced activation within the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) that differentiated mTBI from healthy controls. We conclude that the cognitive impairments in memory and attention typically reported in mTBI patients may be associated with a deficit in the right MFG, which impacts the recruitment of neural networks important for attentional control.",

Many studies have provided evidence that both genetic and environmental factors induce atherosclerosis, leading thus to cardiovascular complications. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease, and aging is strongly associated with the development of atherosclerosis. Recent experimental evidence suggests that clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is an emerging cardiovascular risk factor that contributes to the development of atherosclerosis and cardiac dysfunction and exacerbates cardiovascular diseases. CH is caused by somatic mutations in recurrent genes in hematopoietic stem cells, leading to the clonal expansion of mutated blood cell clones. Many of the mutated genes are known in the context of myeloid neoplasms. However, only some individuals carrying CH mutations develop hematologic abnormalities. CH is clearly age dependent and is not rare: at least 10%-20% of people >70 years old carry CH. The newly discovered association between myeloid leukemia-driver mutations and the progression of CVDs has raised medical interest. In this review, we summarize the current view on the contribution of CH in different cardiovascular diseases, CVD risk assessment, patient stratification, and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

Reperfusion following brain ischemia produces an inflammatory cascade that increases brain damage. In this context, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role as pro-inflammatory mediators. The MMP 2 up-regulation seems to promote matrix degradation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and facilitates the influx of peripheral inflammatory cells to the brain after stroke. However, there are not studies about MMP-1 in this condition. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association of brain damage, inflammatory response and the immunostaining profile of matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 2 after transient global cerebral ischemia. Mice were submitted to bilateral common carotid arterial occlusion (BCCAo) during 25&#160;min. After three days of reperfusion, the neurological deficit score was evaluated and the animals were euthanized. Brain samples were collected in order to analyze the histopathological damage, MMPs 1 and 2 immunostaining and cytokines and chemokines levels. Ischemic group showed neurological deficits associated with brain lesions, characterized by necrotic core and penumbra zone three days after reperfusion. Higher brain immunostaining of MMP-1 and MMP-2 was observed in BCCAo samples than in sham samples. Ischemic group also exhibited increased brain levels of the cytokines tumoral necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 1&#946; (IL-1&#946;), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) in comparison to sham group.

The prevalence of moderate and severe malnutrition was 12.7% and 11.5%, respectively. Ninety-one patients (13.6%) experienced the combined outcome. After adjusting for independent predictors including sex, atrial fibrillation, dysphagia, FIM cognitive score, and hemoglobin levels, neither moderate (P=.280) nor severe malnutrition (P=.482) were associated with the combined outcome. Similar results were observed when looking at 2-year mortality. Overall, FIM motor effectiveness was 30%&#177;24%. After adjusting for independent predictors, severe malnutrition (&#946; coefficient -0.458&#177;0.216; P=.034) was associated with FIM motor effectiveness.\nApproximately 1 in every 9 patients presented severe malnutrition. On top of the independent predictors, severe malnutrition did not provide additional prognostic information concerning risk of the combined outcome or 2-year mortality. Conversely, severe malnutrition was associated with poorer functional outcome as expressed by FIM motor effectiveness.",

Increasingly, rehabilitation for these impairments has moved into the community and home settings through the use of home programs. However, adherence to these programs is often low, limiting effectiveness.\nThis scoping review investigated home program implementation and measurement of adherence with persons post-stroke to identify commonly reported practices and determine areas for further research.\nThe electronic databases of PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and PEDro were searched. Studies focused on post-stroke rehabilitation with an independent home program were selected. Qualitative studies, commentaries, and single-case studies were excluded. Title and abstract screenings were completed by two reviewers with a third for tie-breaking. The full-text review was completed by two reviewers using consensus to resolve any differences. Of the 1,197 articles initially found only 6% (n = 70) met criteria for data extraction. Elements for data extraction included: type of study, area of intervention, description of home program, presence of strategies to support adherence, methods to measure adherence and reported adherence.\nMost commonly reported strategies to support home practice were the use of technology, personalization, and written directions. Only 20 studies reported achieving adherence at or greater than 75% and 18 studies did not report adherence outcomes.\nFuture investigations that directly compare and identify the most effective strategies to support adherence to home programs for this population are warranted. The implementation of guidelines for reporting adherence to home programs is recommended.",

        "abstract": "\nUnlike other international guidelines but in accord with the earlier Japanese Society of Hypertension (JSH) guidelines, the 2019 JSH guidelines (\"JSH 2019\") continue to emphasize the importance of out-of-office blood pressure (BP) measurements obtained with a home BP device. Another unique characteristic of JSH 2019 is that it sets clinical questions about the management of hypertension that are based on systematic reviews of updated evidence. JSH 2019 states that individuals with office BP&#160;<&#160;140/90&#160;mm&#160;Hg do not have normal BP. The final decisions regarding the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension should be performed based on out-of-office BP values together with office BP measurements. For hypertensive adults with comorbidities, the office BP goal is usually <130/80&#160;mm&#160;Hg and the home BP goal is <125/75&#160;mm&#160;Hg. Recommendations of JSH 2019 would be valuable for not only Japanese hypertensive patients but also Asian hypertensive patients, who share the same features including higher incidence of stroke compared with that of myocardial infarction and a steeper blood pressure-vascular event relationship.",

Ischemic heart disease is the most common cause of cardiovascular death, ahead of stroke. Local data suggest that awareness and support for home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) is good, but there are reservations about the accuracy of HBPM devices and physicians cited a lack of time and resources to educate patients about HBPM. In addition, there was a knowledge gap around use of HBPM for evaluating treatment response. This is consistent with the emphasis of using HBPM for the diagnosis, rather than monitoring, of hypertension in the Singapore hypertension guidelines. In the absence of specific HBPM thresholds and targets, it is suggested that HOPE Asia Network consensus documents provide the most locally relevant guidance of the use of HBPM. Calcium channel blockers and angiotensin receptor blockers are the most commonly used antihypertensive agents in Singapore, and monotherapy was relatively uncommon (24%) of patients. Overall, more needs to be done in detecting and managing hypertension in Singapore to address rates of cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease mortality. Use of HBPM needs to be encouraged to improve adherence to treatment and optimize BP targets according to Asian perspectives and data.",

        "abstract": "\nCytoplasmic dynein, an AAA+ motif containing motor, generates force and movement along the microtubule to execute important biological functions including intracellular material transport and cell division by hydrolyzing ATP. Among the six AAA+ domains, AAA1 is the primary ATPase site where a single ATP hydrolysis generates a single step. Nucleotide states in AAA3 gate dynein's activity, suggesting that AAA3 acts as a regulatory switch. However, the comprehensive structural perspective of AAA3 in dynein's mechanochemical cycle remains unclear. Here, we explored the allosteric transition path of dynein involving AAA3 using a coarse-grained structure-based model. ATP binding to the AAA1 domain creates a cascade of conformational changes through the other domains of the ring, which leads to the pre-power stroke formation. The linker domain, which is the mechanical element of dynein, shifts from a straight to a bent conformation during this process. In our present study, we observe that AAA3 gates the allosteric communication from AAA1 to the microtubule binding domain (MTBD) through AAA4 and AAA5. The MTBD is linked to the AAA+ ring via a coiled-coil stalk and a buttress domain, which are extended from AAA4 and AAA5, respectively. Further analysis also uncovers the role of AAA3 in the linker movement. The free energy calculation shows that the linker prefers the straight conformation when AAA3 remains in the ATP-bound condition. As AAA3 restricts the motion of AAA4 and AAA5, the linker/AAA5 interactions get stabilized, and the linker cannot move to the pre-power stroke state that halts the complete structural transition required for the mechanochemical cycle. Therefore, we suggest that AAA3 governs dynein's mechanochemical cycle and motility by controlling the AAA4 and AAA5 domains that further regulate the linker movement and the power stroke formation.",

However, data associating the measurement time of BNP and clinical influence of BNP are limited. Herein, we examined the utility of BNP level for prediction of stroke severity when accounting for measurement time. We retrospectively registered 327 patients admitted within 7&#160;days from onset of ischemic stroke. We collected information on patients' background, stroke risk factors, subtype and severity, and outcome at discharge. Measurement of BNP was performed by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the time of BNP measurement from disease onset. Multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the association of BNP value with outcome after patients were grouped according to BNP measurement time. Of the 327 patients, the numbers of patients whose BNP was measured within 24&#160;h of symptom onset, between 24 and 48&#160;h of symptom onset, and after 48&#160;h of symptom onset were 102, 92, and 133, respectively.

This condition is called vascular HCHB, but the same symptoms can be caused by a completely different striatal lesion. Glycaemic HCHB may occur in patients with uncontrolled hyperglycaemia: basal ganglia hyperdensity is seen on brain CT, while increased T1 signal intensity and reduced susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) and gradient-echo sequences (T2*-GRE) are detected on MRI.\nAn 83-year-old man with multiple vascular risk factors and uncontrolled chronic hyperglycaemia was admitted for ischaemic stroke presenting with dysarthria and mild left hemiparesis. No involuntary movements were reported at admission. The emergent brain CT scan was negative for vascular acute lesions, while a mild bilateral hyperdensity of the striata was detectable. Involuntary movements on the left side of the body, consistent with HCHB, appeared 27 days later. The alterations on brain CT completely disappeared after 3 months. On brain MRI, the T1 signal alterations resolved after 10 months, while SWI and T2*-GRE sequences showed persisting alterations after 2 years.\nDetailed brain imaging demonstrated evolution of striatal alterations of glycaemic HCHB before the appearance of involuntary movements and during the following 2 years. The association between ischaemic stroke and glycaemic HCHB favours the hypothesis that chronic hyperglycaemia more likely determines striatal alterations and the clinical picture of HCHB when vascular hypoperfusion also occurs.\nHemichorea-hemiballism (HCHB) may appear in patients with uncontrolled hyperglycaemia accompanied by typical neuroradiological features consisting of striatal alterations detectable on brain CT and MRI, often bilaterally.Unusually, striatal alterations can be detected before the appearance of involuntary movements and are fully reversible on brain CT and T1-MRI sequences.Brain hypoperfusion may facilitate the appearance of typical HCHB in patients with chronic hyperglycaemia.",

The aim of this review was to investigate the relationship between hemoglobin A1c and serum troponin in patients with diabetes and cardiovascular events.\nHemoglobin A1c has been chosen as the best clinical indicator of glucose control and risk of micro and macrovascular complications. We investigated cardiac troponins as a group of markers of muscle injury which includes troponin T, troponin I and troponin C. Troponin T and I are specific for myocardial injury, compared to C which is specific for skeletal muscle.\nIn this review, we showed that there was a causal relation between hemoglobin A1c levels and serum troponin concentrations. Hemoglobin A1c has shown to be a positive predictive factor of incidence, mortality and morbidity of conditions such as acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias, stroke, pulmonary embolism and other conditions that causes troponin elevation by its release in circulation.\nChronic hyperglycemia decreases glomerular filtration and consequently decreases troponin elimination and also by affecting the heart microcirculation it leads to microvascular damage and consequently to ischemia which contribute to troponin concentration elevation.

Outcomes evaluated were all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiac/cerebrovascular events (MACCE), cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and repeat revascularization.\nSixteen studies were included (18,224 patients). PCI was associated with the increase risk for MACCE (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.38-1.85), cardiac death (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.11-2.80), MI (RR 1.98, 95% CI 1.53-2.57), repeat revascularization (RR 2.61, 95% CI 2.08-3.29). The risks for all-cause mortality (RR 1.23, 95% CI 1.00-1.52) and stroke (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.48-1.03) were similar between two strategies. Stratified analysis based on studies design and duration of follow-up showed largely similar findings with the overall analyses, except for a significant increased risk of all-cause mortality (RR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.67) in long-term group, and CABG was associated with a higher stroke rate compared to PCI, which are results that were found in RCTs (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.28-0.79) and mid-term groups (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.23-0.66).\nCABG was superior to PCI for diabetic patients with complex CAD (including left main CAD and/or MVD), but might be associated with a higher risk of stroke mid-term follow-up.Number of Protocol registration PROSPERO CRD 42019138505.",

        "abstract": "\nBrachyuran crabs can effectively modulate cardiac stroke volume independently of heart rate in response to abiotic drivers. Non-invasive techniques can help to improve the understanding of cardiac performance parameters of these animals. This study demonstrates the in vivo quantification of cardiac performance parameters through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#160;on the edible crab Cancer pagurus. Furthermore, the suitability of signal integrals of infra-red photoplethysmographs as a qualitative tool is assessed under severe hypoxia.\nMulti-slice self-gated cardiac cinematic (CINE) MRI revealed the structure and motion of the ventricle to quantify heart rates, end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume and ejection fraction. CINE MRI showed that stroke volumes increased under hypoxia because of a reduction of end-systolic volumes at constant end-diastolic volumes. Plethysmograph recordings allowed for automated heart rate measurements but determination of a qualitative stroke volume proxy strongly depended on the position of the sensor on the animal. Both techniques revealed a doubling in stroke volumes after 6&#8201;h under severe hypoxia (water PO2&#8201;=&#8201;15% air saturation).\nMRI has allowed for detailed descriptions of cardiac performance in intact animals under hypoxia. The temporal resolution of quantitative non-invasive CINE MRI is limited but should encourage further refining. The stroke volume proxy based on plethysmograph recordings is feasible to complement other cardiac measurements over time. The presented methods allow for non-destructive in vivo determinations of multiple cardiac performance parameters, with the possibility to study neuro-hormonal or environmental effects on decapod cardio physiology.",

        "abstract": "\nThe cut-off values of walking velocity and classification of functional mobility both have a role in clinical settings for assessing the walking function of stroke patients and setting rehabilitation goals and treatment plans.\nThe present study investigated whether the cut-off values of the modified Rivermead Mobility Index (mRMI) and walking velocity accurately differentiated the walking ability of stroke patients according to the modified Functional Ambulation Category (mFAC).\nEighty two chronic stroke patients were included in the study. The comfortable/maximum walking velocities and mRMI were used to measure the mobility outcomes of these patients. To compare the walking velocities and mRMI scores for each mFAC point, one-way analysis of variance and the post-hoc test using Scheffe's method were performed. The patients were categorized according to gait ability into either mFAC = VII  or mFAC &#8804; VI group. The cut-off values for mRMI and walking velocities were calculated using a receiver-operating characteristic curve. The odds ratios of logistic regression analysis (Wald Forward) were analyzed to examine whether the cut-off values of walking velocity and mRMI can be utilized to differentiate functional walking levels.\nExcept for mFACs III and IV, maximum walking velocity differed between mFAC IV and mFAC V ( p < 0 . 01 ) , between mFAC V and mFAC VI ( p < 0 . 001 ) , and between mFAC VI and mFAC VII ( p < 0 . 05 ) . The cut-off value of mRMI is > 26 . 5 and the area under the curve is 0.87, respectively; the cut-off value for comfortable walking velocity is > 0 . 77 m/s and the area under the curve is 0.92, respectively; also, the cut-off value for maximum walking velocity is > 0 . 92 m/s and the area under the curve is 0.97, respectively. In the logistic regression analysis, the maximum walking velocity ( > 0 . 92 m/s, OR = 22 . 027 ) and mRMI ( > 26 . 5 scores, OR = 10 . 283 ) are able to distinguish mFAC = VII  from mFAC &#8804; VI.\nThe cut-off values of maximum walking velocity and mRMI are recommended as useful outcome measures for assessing ambulation levels in chronic stroke patients during rehabilitation.",

Facilitation of normal gait is a primary goal of rehabilitation on these patients.\nWe aimed to investigate whether walking assist device with auxiliary illuminator (quad-cane with laser) providing visual feedback during ambulation could improve parameters of gait cycle immediately among patients with subacute and chronic stroke.\nThis was a cross-sectional study and 30 participants (male 23, female 7, group 1) with mean age 60 . 20 &#177; 11 . 12 years were recruited. Among them, 22 used ankle-foot orthosis [(AFO), group 2] and 8 did not use AFO (group 3) at usual walking. All the participants walked along a strait corridor with even surface for 20 m without and with using a quad-cane with laser, respectively. A gait analyzer (Reha-Watch1 system) was used to measure the changes of the parameters of gait cycle, including stride length, cadence, gait speed, stance phase, swing phase, duration of single support and double support, the angle between toes and the ground at the time of toe-off (the toe-off angle) and the angle between calcaneus and the ground at the time of heel-strike (the heel-strike angle), before and with the use of a quad-cane with laser.\nThe increase in the heel-strike angle reached a significant difference in groups&#160;1 2, and 3 ( p = 0 . 02 ,< 0 . 01 , and = 0 . 05 , respectively). However, the stride length, the gait speed, the cadence, percentage of the stance phase, swing phase, single-support phase, and double-support phase in a gait cycle, and the toe-off angle showed no significant change with the use of quad-cane with laser.\nPatients after acute stroke had an immediate and significant increase in the heel-stroke angle by using a quad-cane with laser during ambulation, which might help the patients to reduce knee hyperextension moment and lessen the pressure of heel at loading phase.",

This study used Time Resolved Angiography with Interleaved Stochastic Trajectories (TWIST) Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) to examine contrast circulation in a cohort of patients with Fontan circulation who were having routine MRI follow up to inform the contrast timing of any subsequent CT.\nThis is a single centre, cross-sectional, observational, retrospective study. The time to peak (TTP) signal intensity from the MRA was recorded using regions of interest on the aorta, pulmonary arteries, cavae and Fontan conduit. Patients were grouped by ejection fraction, global longitudinal strain, indexed stroke volume and cardiac index to examine if these cardiac performance parameters affected the mean TTP. Statistical analysis was performed to find the mean TTP for each of the vessels, which was consequently compared between the different cardiac performance parameters.\n35 patients were included in the study. Mean TTP contrast enhancement was 31s in the thoracic aorta, 46s in the right pulmonary artery, 41s in the left pulmonary artery and 55s in the Fontan conduit. Cardiac performance shows no statistically significant relationship to the peak contrast enhancement whether measured by ejection fraction, global longitudinal strain, stroke volume index or cardiac index.\nThe mean optimal timing for a single-phase examination of the Fontan circulation, following an upper limb injection, was 55&#160;s following start of contrast injection irrespective of cardiac performance. In TWIST MRA, the IV bolus is 4-5&#160;s duration. A longer bolus is required for CTA, around 20s, suggesting an additional delay will be required. We propose that an optimal single phase CTPA to be protocolled at 70&#160;s following the start of contrast injection, assuming adequate iodinated contrast dose.",

The World Federation of Neurosurgery and Fisher grading scales as well as the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale were documented at discharge and after a 3-to-6-month follow-up period. C-reactive protein, d-dimer, white blood count, and procalcitonin were assessed on admission, day 1, day 4, day 9, day 14, and at discharge. Radiologically confirmed delayed cerebral ischemia before discharge was the primary endpoint. Severe angiographic vasospasm and outcome were used as secondary endpoints.\nDelayed cerebral ischemia occurred in 19.6% of the 138 patients included. Delayed cerebral ischemia correlated with severe vasospasm and with a worse outcome. Serum C-reactive protein levels were higher in patients with severe vasospasm during the period of vasospasm. D-dimer levels on admission correlated with Fisher grades. Delayed cerebral ischemia occurred more frequently in patients with Fisher grade IV hemorrhage, if d-dimer levels were higher on admission. The cut-off was .445 &#181;g/ml.\nOur observations support a multifactorial genesis for delayed cerebral ischemia, including vasospasm and microthrombotic and inflammatory processes. Serum d-dimer levels greater than .445 &#181;g/ml might be a predictor for the occurrence of delayed cerebral ischemia in patients with a Fisher grade IV aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.",

Although stem cell-based therapy has been proposed as an exciting regenerative medicine strategy for brain injury, there are limitations. The developed cerebral organoids (COs) represent a promising transplantation source for stroke that remains to be answered. Here, we transplanted COs at 55&#160;days and explored the feasibility in the rat middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model of stroke. COs transplantation at 6&#160;h or even 24&#160;h after MCAO significantly reduces brain infarct volume and improves neurological motor function. Transplanted COs show the potential of multilineage differentiation to mimic in vivo cortical development, support motor cortex region-specific reconstruction, form neurotransmitter-related neurons, and achieve synaptic connection with host brain via in situ differentiation and cell replacement in stroke. Cells from transplanted COs show extensive migration into different brain regions along corpus callosum. The mechanisms underlying COs transplantation therapy are also associated with enhanced neurogenesis, synaptic reconstruction, axonal regeneration and angiogenesis, and decreased neural apoptosis with more survival neurons after stroke. Moreover, COs transplantation promotes predominantly exogenous neurogenesis in the transplantation periphery of ipsilateral cortex and predominantly endogenous neurogenesis in the hippocampus and subventricular zone. Together, we demonstrate the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of COs transplantation in stroke. This preliminary but promising study provides first-hand preclinical evidence for COs transplantation as a potential and effective intervention for stroke treatment.",

Instituting secondary prevention and attention to bowel and bladder problems can help reduce medical complications and re-admissions, while adequate analgesia, positioning/splinting of limbs and physiotherapy can lessen discomfort and preventable suffering.

        "abstract": "\nRecovery after stroke is a multicellular process encompassing neurons, resident immune cells, and brain-invading cells. Stroke alters the gut microbiome, which in turn has considerable impact on stroke outcome. However, the mechanisms underlying gut-brain interaction and implications for long-term recovery are largely elusive. Here, we tested the hypothesis that short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), key bioactive microbial metabolites, are the missing link along the gut-brain axis and might be able to modulate recovery after experimental stroke. SCFA supplementation in the drinking water of male mice significantly improved recovery of affected limb motor function. Using in vivo wide-field calcium imaging, we observed that SCFAs induced altered contralesional cortex connectivity. This was associated with SCFA-dependent changes in spine and synapse densities. RNA sequencing of the forebrain cortex indicated a potential involvement of microglial cells in contributing to the structural and functional remodeling. Further analyses confirmed a substantial impact of SCFAs on microglial activation, which depended on the recruitment of T cells to the infarcted brain. Our findings identified that microbiota-derived SCFAs modulate poststroke recovery via effects on systemic and brain resident immune cells.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Previous studies have shown a bidirectional communication along the gut-brain axis after stroke. Stroke alters the gut microbiota composition, and in turn, microbiota dysbiosis has a substantial impact on stroke outcome by modulating the immune response. However, until now, the mediators derived from the gut microbiome affecting the gut-immune-brain axis and the molecular mechanisms involved in this process were unknown. Here, we demonstrate that short-chain fatty acids, fermentation products of the gut microbiome, are potent and proregenerative modulators of poststroke neuronal plasticity at various structural levels. We identified that this effect was mediated via circulating lymphocytes on microglial activation. These results identify short-chain fatty acids as a missing link along the gut-brain axis and as a potential therapeutic to improve recovery after stroke.",

        "abstract": "\nAdults with disability as the result of an acquired neurological disorder often have varying and complex support needs. Consequently, adults with complex needs often require paid support to enable them to exercise choice and control and participate fully and effectively in society. Given support is so critical for this population, this scoping review aims to further understand the factors that influence the quality of paid disability support for adults with acquired neurological disability and complex needs.\nThe methodology proposed by Arksey and O'Malley, with the modifications recommended by Levac and O'Brien and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis: extension for Scoping Reviews will be used. Systematic and comprehensive electronic database searches will be conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus and Embase. The review will follow a six-stage framework including (1) identifying the research question/s, (2) identifying the relevant studies, with (3) study selection and (4) charting of data by two independent coders, (5) collating, summarising and reporting data and (6) expert consultation which will be sought from people with lived experience, as well as clinical and academic experts. Work on this scoping review began in June 2019 and will be completed by June 2020.\nEthical approval will not be required to conduct the scoping review. However, the consultation with people with lived experience will be conducted via codesign workshops. The codesign workshops have received ethical approval from La Trobe University Ethics Committee (reference number: HEC19232). It is intended that review findings will be made available to relevant stakeholders through a peer-reviewed publication, conference presentations and workshops.",

        "abstract": "\nClinical guidelines recommend non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) for stroke prevention in most patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Frail elderly were under-represented in the landmark NOAC-trials, leaving a knowledge gap on the optimal anticoagulant management (VKA or NOAC) in this increasing population. The aim of the Frail-AF (FRAIL-AF) study is to assess whether switching from international normalised ratio (INR)-guided VKA-management to a NOAC-based treatment strategy compared with continuing VKA-management is safe in frail elderly patients with AF.\nThe FRAIL-AF study is a pragmatic, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled clinical trial. Frail elderly (age &#8805;75 years plus a Groningen Frailty Indicator score &#8805;3) who receive VKA-treatment for AF in the absence of a mechanical heart valve or severe mitral valve stenosis will be randomised to switch to a NOAC-based treatment strategy or to continue INR-guided VKA-management. Patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30&#8201;mL/min/1.73&#8201;m2) will be excluded from randomisation. Based on existing trial evidence in non-frail patients, we will aim to explore whether NOAC-treatment is superior to VKA-therapy in reducing major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding events. Secondary outcomes include minor bleeding, the composite of ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness. The follow-up period for all subjects is 12 months.\nThe protocol was approved by the Medical Research Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht, the Netherlands and by the Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects, the Netherlands. All patients are asked written informed consent. Results are expected in 2022 and will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals as well as presentations at national and international conferences.\nEudraCT: 2017-000393-11; The Netherlands Trial Registry: 6721 (FRAIL-AF study).",

During 900&#8201;214 person years of follow-up, 3540 cases of incident stroke were identified, of which 63.0% (n=2230) were ischemic and 27.5% (n=973) were hemorrhagic.

For each increase of 10 &#956;g/m3 in PM2.5 concentration, the increased risks of incident stroke, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke were 13% (1.13, 1.09 to 1.17), 20% (1.20, 1.15 to 1.25), and 12% (1.12, 1.05 to 1.20), respectively. Almost linear exposure-response relations between long term exposure to PM2.5 and incident stroke, overall and by its subtypes, were observed.\nThis study provides evidence from China that long term exposure to ambient PM2.5 at relatively high concentrations is positively associated with incident stroke and its major subtypes.

An overdispersed generalised additive model was used to estimate city specific associations between PM2.5 and cardiovascular admissions, and random effects meta-analysis used to combine the city specific estimates.\nOver the study period, a mean of 47 hospital admissions per day (standard deviation 74) occurred for cardiovascular disease, 26 (53) for ischaemic heart disease, one (five) for heart failure, two (four) for heart rhythm disturbances, 14 (28) for ischaemic stroke, and two (four) for haemorrhagic stroke. At the national average level, an increase of 10 &#956;g/m3 in PM2.5 was associated with a 0.26% (95% confidence interval 0.17% to 0.35%) increase in hospital admissions on the same day for cardiovascular disease, 0.31% (0.22% to 0.40%) for ischaemic heart disease, 0.27% (0.04% to 0.51%) for heart failure, 0.29% (0.12% to 0.46%) for heart rhythm disturbances, and 0.29% (0.18% to 0.40%) for ischaemic stroke, but not with haemorrhagic stroke (-0.02% (-0.23% to 0.19%)). The national average association of PM2.5 with cardiovascular disease was slightly non-linear, with a sharp slope at PM2.5 levels below 50 &#956;g/m3, a moderate slope at 50-250 &#956;g/m3, and a plateau at concentrations higher than 250 &#956;g/m3.

Assuming causality, which should be done with caution, this reduction would translate into an estimated 36&#8201;448 (95% confidence interval 24&#8201;441 to 48&#8201;471), 85&#8201;270 (57&#8201;129 to 113&#8201;494), and 97&#8201;516 (65&#8201;320 to 129&#8201;820), respectively.\nThese data suggest that in China, short term exposure to PM2.5 is associated with increased hospital admissions for all major cardiovascular diseases except for haemorrhagic stroke, even for exposure levels not exceeding the current regulatory limits.",

        "abstract": "\nSpreading depolarizations (SD) are characterized by breakdown of transmembrane ion gradients and excitotoxicity. Experimentally, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists block a majority of SDs. In many hospitals, the NMDAR antagonist s-ketamine and the GABAA agonist midazolam represent the current second-line combination treatment to sedate patients with devastating cerebral injuries. A pressing clinical question is whether this option should become first-line in sedation-requiring individuals in whom SDs are detected, yet the s-ketamine dose necessary to adequately inhibit SDs is unknown. Moreover, use-dependent tolerance could be a problem for SD inhibition in the clinic.\nWe performed a retrospective cohort study of 66 patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) from a prospectively collected database. Thirty-three of 66 patients received s-ketamine during electrocorticographic neuromonitoring of SDs in neurointensive care. The decision to give s-ketamine was dependent on the need for stronger sedation, so it was expected that patients receiving s-ketamine would have a worse clinical outcome.\nS-ketamine application started 4.2&#8201;&#177;&#8201;3.5&#8201;days after aSAH. The mean dose was 2.8&#8201;&#177;&#8201;1.4&#8201;mg/kg body weight (BW)/h and thus higher than the dose recommended for sedation. First, patients were divided according to whether they received s-ketamine at any time or not. No significant difference in SD counts was found between groups (negative binomial model using the SD count per patient as outcome variable, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.288). This most likely resulted from the fact that 368 SDs had already occurred in the s-ketamine group before s-ketamine was given. However, in patients receiving s-ketamine, we found a significant decrease in SD incidence when s-ketamine was started (Poisson model with a random intercept for patient, coefficient -&#8201;1.83 (95% confidence intervals -&#8201;2.17; -&#8201;1.50), p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001; logistic regression model, odds ratio (OR) 0.13 (0.08; 0.19), p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). Thereafter, data was further divided into low-dose (0.1-2.0&#8201;mg/kg BW/h) and high-dose (2.1-7.0&#8201;mg/kg/h) segments. High-dose s-ketamine resulted in further significant decrease in SD incidence (Poisson model, -&#8201;1.10 (-&#8201;1.71; -&#8201;0.49), p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001; logistic regression model, OR 0.33 (0.17; 0.63), p&#8201;<&#8201;0.001). There was little evidence of SD tolerance to long-term s-ketamine sedation through 5&#8201;days.\nThese results provide a foundation for a multicenter, neuromonitoring-guided, proof-of-concept trial of ketamine and midazolam as a first-line sedative regime.",

However, concerns about the thromboembolic risk of this approach are still prevalent. Our study therefore aims to assess if such a haemostatic management is associated with an increased risk for thromboembolic events.\nIn this retrospective observational study carried out at the University Hospital Zurich we compared two three-year periods before (period 1: 2005-2007) and after (period 2: 2012-2014) implementation of a factor-based coagulation algorithm. We included all adult patients following major trauma primarily admitted to the University Hospital Zurich. Thromboembolic events were defined as a new in-hospital appearance of any peripheral thrombosis, arterial embolism, pulmonary embolism, stroke or myocardial infarction. A logistic regression was performed to investigate the association of thromboembolic events with possible confounders such as age, sex, specific Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) subgroups, allogeneic blood products, and the coagulation management.\nOut of 1138 patients, 772 met the inclusion criteria: 344 patients in period 1 and 428 patients in period 2. Thromboembolic events were present in 25 patients (7.3%) of period 1 and in 42 patients (9.8%) of period 2 (raw OR 1.39, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.33, p&#8201;=&#8201;0.21).

Histologically, several pathological signatures of NMOSD could be recognized in the lesion, including inflammatory cell infiltrations by B and T lymphocytes, perivascular complement and fibrinogen deposition, and the appearance of numerous phagocytosed corpora amylacea within the infiltrating macrophages.\nThe present case illustrates that basal ganglia may be directly involved in the pathological processes of NMOSD, although the possibility of modification of the lesions by superimposed regional ischemia could not be excluded.",

        "abstract": "\nThe aim of this systematic review is to determine the epidemiological and etiological profiles, the influential factors of the prehospital delay, thrombolysis management, the acute and 3-month mortality rate and the genetic aspect of ischemic stroke in Morocco.\nThe present work is a systematic review that was conducted according to the recommendations of the \"Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis\". We used Pubmed, Sciencedirect, Scopus, Clinicalkey, and Google scholar databases for the raking of the gray literature during the time frame 2009 and 2018. The protocol of the review was registered in the PROSPERO register (CRD42018115206). These studies were analyzed based on: Age, sex ratio, risk factors, etiological profile according to Trial of ORG classification 10,172 in Acute Stroke Treatment, prehospital delay average and its influential factors, thrombolyzed patients' proportion, acute and 3-month mortality and the genetic factors of ischemic stroke in Morocco.\nTwenty-nine (n&#160;=&#8201;29) studies were selected. The average age ranged from 49&#8201;&#177;&#8201;15.2 to 67.3&#8201;&#177;&#8201;9.9&#8201;years old. Moreover, we reported male predominance within all ages in 13 studies. High blood pressure, diabetes, smoking and heart disease were the four identified main risk factors by the prementioned studies. Atherosclerosis and cardioembolic were the main described etiologies of cerebral ischemia, and the average prehospital time ranged from 26 to 61.9&#8201;h. The proportion of thrombolysed patients ranged from 1.8% to 2.9%, the mortality rate varied in the acute phase from 3 to 13%, and the 3-month mortality ranged from 4.3 to 32.5%. It is also important to highlight that most of these studies, which were conducted in hospital environment, have a reduced sample size and no confidence interval.\nIschemic stroke is affecting more likely the young population with male predominance. Moreover, the long prehospital delay and the low proportion of thrombolysed patients are alarming. This indicates the need to investigate in depth the key factors influencing the access to care for Moroccan patients in order to improve the management of this neurologic deficit in Morocco.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground We aimed to determine if there is an association between hospital quality and the likelihood of a given hospital being a preferred transfer destination for stroke patients. Methods and Results Data from Medicare claims identified acute ischemic stroke transferred between 394 northeast US hospitals from 2007 to 2011. Hospitals were categorized as transferring (n=136), retaining (n=241), or receiving (n=17) hospitals based on the proportion of acute ischemic stroke encounters transferred or received. We identified all 6409 potential dyads of sending and receiving hospitals, and categorized dyads as connected if &#8805;5 patients were transferred between the hospitals annually (n=82). We used logistic regression to identify hospital characteristics associated with establishing a connected dyad, exploring the effect of adjusting for different quality measures and outcomes. We also adjusted for driving distance between hospitals, receiving hospital stroke volume, and the number of hospitals in the receiving hospital referral region. The odds of establishing a transfer connection increased when rate of alteplase administration increased at the receiving hospital or decreased at the sending hospital, however this finding did not hold after applying a potential strategy to adjust for clustering. Receiving hospital performance on 90-day home time was not associated with likelihood of transfer connection. Conclusions Among northeast US hospitals, we found that differences in hospital quality, specifically higher levels of alteplase administration, may be associated with increased likelihood of being a transfer destination. Further research is needed to better understand acute ischemic stroke transfer patterns to optimize stroke transfer systems.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground and Purpose- Oral anticoagulation therapy is standard of care for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation to prevent stroke. This study compared rivaroxaban and warfarin for stroke and all-cause mortality risk reduction in a real-world setting. Methods- This retrospective cohort study (2011-2017) included de-identified patients from the Optum Clinformatics Database who started treatment with rivaroxaban or warfarin within 30 days following initial diagnosis of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Before nonvalvular atrial fibrillation diagnosis, patients had 6 months of continuous health plan enrollment and CHA2DS2-VASc score &#8805;2. Stroke severity was determined by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, imputed based on machine learning algorithms. Stroke and all-cause mortality risks were compared by treatment using Cox proportional hazard regression, with inverse probability of treatment weighting to balance cohorts for baseline risk factors. Stratified analysis by treatment duration was also performed. Results- During a mean follow-up of 27 months, 175 (1.33/100 patient-years [PY]) rivaroxaban-treated and 536 (1.66/100 PY) warfarin-treated patients developed stroke. The inverse probability of treatment weighting model showed that rivaroxaban reduced stroke risk by 19% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81 [95% CI, 0.73-0.91]). Analysis by stroke severity revealed risk reductions by rivaroxaban of 48% for severe stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 16-42; HR, 0.52 [95% CI, 0.33-0.82]) and 19% for minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 1 to <5; HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.68-0.96]), but no difference for moderate stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 5 to <16; HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.78-1.10]). A total of 41 (0.31/100 PY) rivaroxaban-treated and 147 (0.44/100 PY) warfarin-treated patients died poststroke, 12 (0.09/100 PY) and 67 (0.20/100 PY) of whom died within 30 days, representing mortality risk reductions by rivaroxaban of 24% (HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.61-0.95]) poststroke and 59% (HR, 0.41 [95% CI, 0.28-0.60]) within 30 days. Conclusions- After the initial diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, patients treated with rivaroxaban versus warfarin had significant risk reduction for stroke, especially severe stroke, and all-cause mortality after a stroke. Findings from this observational study may help inform anticoagulant choice for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation.",

        "abstract": "\nTo investigate the changes in the expression of specific genes that occur during the acute-to-chronic post-stroke phase, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between naive cortical tissues and peri-infarct tissues at 1, 4, and 8 weeks after photothrombotic stroke. The profiles of DEGs were subjected to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and gene ontology analyses, followed by string analysis of the protein-protein interactions (PPI) of the products of these genes. We found 3771, 536, and 533 DEGs at 1, 4, and 8 weeks after stroke, respectively. A marked decrease in biological-process categories, such as brain development and memory, and a decrease in neurotransmitter synaptic and signaling pathways were observed 1 week after stroke. The PPI analysis showed the downregulation of Dlg4, Bdnf, Gria1, Rhoa, Mapk8, and glutamatergic receptors. An increase in biological-process categories, including cell population proliferation, cell adhesion, and inflammatory responses, was detected at 4 and 8 weeks post-stroke. The KEGG pathways of complement and coagulation cascades, phagosomes, antigen processing, and antigen presentation were also altered. CD44, C1, Fcgr2b, Spp1, and Cd74 occupied a prominent position in network analyses. These time-dependent changes in gene profiles reveal the unique pathophysiological characteristics of stroke and suggest new therapeutic targets for this disease.",

        "abstract": "\nVirtual reality (VR) games has the potential to improve patient outcomes in stroke rehabilitation. However, there is limited information on VR games as an adjunct to standard physiotherapy in improving upper limb function. This study involved 36 participants in both experimental (n = 18) and control (n = 18) groups with a mean age (SD) of 57 (8.20) and 63 (10.54) years, respectively. Outcome measures were the Fugl-Meyer assessment for upper extremities (FMA-UE), Wolf motor function test (WMFT), intrinsic motivation inventory (IMI), Lawton of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and stroke impact scale (SIS) assessed at pre-post intervention. The experimental group had 0.5 h of upper limb (UL) VR games with 1.5 h of standard physiotherapy, and the control group received 2 h of standard physiotherapy. The intervention for both groups was performed once a week for eight consecutive weeks. The results showed a significant time-group interaction effect for IMI (p = 0.001), Lawton IADL (p = 0.01) and SIS domain of communication (p = 0.03). A significant time effect was found in FMA-UE (p = 0.001), WMFT (p = 0.001), Lawton IADL (p = 0.01), and SIS domains; strength, ADL and stroke recovery (p < 0.05). These results indicated an improvement in UL motor ability, sensory function, instrumental ADL, and quality of life in both groups after eight weeks of intervention. However, no significant (p > 0.05) group effect on all the outcome measures was demonstrated. Thus, replacing a portion of standard physiotherapy time with VR games was equally effective in improving UL function and general health compared to receiving only standard physiotherapy among stroke survivors.",

        "abstract": "\nCirculating microRNAs offer attractive potential as epigenetic disease biomarkers by virtue of their biological stability and ready accessibility in liquid biopsies. Numerous clinical cohort studies have revealed unique microRNA profiles in different disease settings, suggesting utility as markers with diagnostic and prognostic applications. Given the complex network of microRNA functions in modulating gene expression and post-transcriptional modifications, the circulating microRNA landscape in disease may reflect pathophysiological status, providing valuable information for delineating distinct subtypes and/or stages of complex diseases. Heart failure (HF) is an increasingly significant global health challenge, imposing major economic liability and health care burden due to high hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality rates. Although HF is defined as a syndrome characterized by symptoms and findings on physical examination, it may be further differentiated based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and categorized as HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). The presenting clinical syndromes in HFpEF and HFrEF are similar but mortality differs, being somewhat lower in HFpEF than in HFrEF. However, while HFrEF is responsive to an array of therapies, none has been shown to improve survival in HFpEF. Herein, we review recent HF cohort studies focusing on the distinct microRNA profiles associated with HF subtypes to reveal new insights to underlying mechanisms and explore the possibility of exploiting these differences for diagnostic/prognostic applications.",

Methods: Seventeen stroke patients (12 female and five male; mean age &#177; SD: 66.5 &#177; 12.9 years) were randomly selected in a stroke rehabilitation hospital. Patients' regional cerebral blood oxygen saturation (rSO2) values were recorded before, during, and after needle acupuncture (scalp, ear and body) as well as before, during, and after corresponding laser stimulation (red laser, four points: 100 mW, 658 nm, 500 &#181;m; yellow laser, one point: 50 mW, 589 nm, 500 &#181;m; infrared laser, three points: 100 mW, 810 nm, 500 &#181;m; green laser, one point: 5 mW, 532 nm, 500 &#181;m) in a cross-over study design. Results: There were no significant changes after needle acupuncture in the phases immediately after needle insertion or during acupuncture stimulation. However, after manual needle acupuncture and after laser stimulation, the majority of the rSO2 values showed increases. The highest value (+3%) was reached after laser stimulation treatment. Heart rate and blood pressure before and after the treatments did not show significant alterations.

        "abstract": "\nCCL11 has recently been shown to differentially affect cell survival under various pathological conditions including stroke. Indeed, CCL11 promotes neuroregeneration in neonatal stroke mice. The impact of CCL11 on the adult ischemic brain, however, remains elusive. We therefore studied the effect of ectopic CCL11 on both adolescent (six-week) and adult (six-month) C57BL6 mice exposed to stroke. Intraperitoneal application of CCL11 significantly aggravated acute brain injury in adult mice but not in adolescent mice. Likewise, post-stroke neurological recovery after four weeks was significantly impaired in adult mice whilst CCL11 was present. On the contrary, CCL11 stimulated gliogenesis and neurogenesis in adolescent mice. Flow cytometry analysis of blood and brain samples revealed a modification of inflammation by CCL11 at subacute stages of the disease. In adolescent mice, CCL11 enhances microglial cell, B and T lymphocyte migration towards the brain, whereas only the number of B lymphocytes is increased in the adult brain. Finally, the CCL11 inhibitor SB297006 significantly reversed the aforementioned effects. Our study, for the first time, demonstrates CCL11 to be a key player in mediating secondary cell injury under stroke conditions. Interfering with this pathway, as shown for SB297006, might thus be an interesting approach for future stroke treatment paradigms.",

        "abstract": "\nExtracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) have great promise as biologics to treat neurological and neurodegenerative conditions due to their robust antiinflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Besides, intranasal (IN) administration of EVs has caught much attention because the procedure is noninvasive, amenable for repetitive dispensation, and leads to a quick penetration of EVs into multiple regions of the forebrain. Nonetheless, it is unknown whether brain injury-induced signals are essential for the entry of IN-administered EVs into different brain regions. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the distribution of IN-administered hMSC-derived EVs into neurons and microglia in the intact and status epilepticus (SE) injured rat forebrain. Ten billion EVs labeled with PKH26 were dispensed unilaterally into the left nostril of na&#239;ve rats, and rats that experienced two hours of kainate-induced SE. Six hours later, PKH26 + EVs were quantified from multiple forebrain regions using serial brain sections processed for different neural cell markers and confocal microscopy. Remarkably, EVs were seen bilaterally in virtually all regions of intact and SE-injured forebrain. The percentage of neurons incorporating EVs were comparable for most forebrain regions. However, in animals that underwent SE, a higher percentage of neurons incorporated EVs in the hippocampal CA1 subfield and the entorhinal cortex, the regions that typically display neurodegeneration after SE. In contrast, the incorporation of EVs by microglia was highly comparable in every region of the forebrain measured. Thus, unilateral IN administration of EVs is efficient for delivering EVs bilaterally into neurons and microglia in multiple regions in the intact or injured forebrain. Furthermore, incorporation of EVs by neurons is higher in areas of brain injury, implying that injury-related signals likely play a role in targeting of EVs into neurons, which may be beneficial for EV therapy in various neurodegenerative conditions including traumatic brain injury, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease.",

        "abstract": "\nCharacterizing the relationship between genetic, epigenetic (e.g., deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] methylation), and transcript variation could provide insights into mechanisms regulating hemostasis and potentially identify new drug targets. Several hemostatic factors are synthesized in the liver, yet high-resolution DNA methylation data from human liver tissue is currently lacking for these genes. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can influence DNA methylation in cis which can affect gene expression. This can be analyzed through allele-specific methylation (ASM) experiments. We performed targeted genomic DNA- and bisulfite-sequencing of 35 hemostatic genes in human liver samples for SNP and DNA methylation analysis, respectively, and integrated the data for ASM determination. ASM-associated SNPs (ASM-SNPs) were tested for association to gene expression in liver using in-house generated ribonucleic acid-sequencing data. We then assessed whether ASM-SNPs associated with gene expression, plasma proteins, or other traits relevant for hemostasis using publicly available data. We identified 112 candidate ASM-SNPs. Of these, 68% were associated with expression of their respective genes in human liver or in other human tissues and 54% were associated with the respective plasma protein levels, activity, or other relevant hemostatic genome-wide association study traits such as venous thromboembolism, coronary artery disease, stroke, and warfarin dose maintenance. Our study provides the first detailed map of the DNA methylation landscape and ASM analysis of hemostatic genes in human liver tissue, and suggests that methylation regulated by genetic variants in cis may provide a mechanistic link between noncoding SNPs and variation observed in circulating hemostatic proteins, prothrombotic diseases, and drug response.",

Patients with cerebellar dizziness and vertigo usually show a pattern of deficits in smooth pursuit, gaze-holding, saccade accuracy, or fixation-suppression of the vestibulo-ocular reflex. Central fixation nystagmus (e.g., downbeat nystagmus), gaze-evoked nystagmus, central positional nystagmus, or head-shaking nystagmus with cross-coupling (i.e., horizontal head shaking causing inappropriate vertical nystagmus) occurs frequently. Overlap syndromes with peripheral vestibular disorders, such as cerebellar ataxia, neuropathy, and vestibular areflexia, exist rarely. Posturography and gait analysis can contribute to diagnostic differentiation, estimation of the risk of falls, as well as quantification of progression and treatment effects.

        "title": "Computational quantification of brain perivascular space morphologies: Associations with vascular risk factors and white matter hyperintensities. A study in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936.",
        "abstract": "\nPerivascular Spaces (PVS), also known as Virchow-Robin spaces, seen on structural brain MRI, are important fluid drainage conduits and are associated with small vessel disease (SVD). Computational quantification of visible PVS may enable efficient analyses in large datasets and increase sensitivity to detect associations with brain disorders. We assessed the associations of computationally-derived PVS parameters with vascular factors and white matter hyperintensities (WMH), a marker of SVD.\nCommunity dwelling individuals (n&#160;=&#160;700) from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 who had multimodal brain MRI at age 72.6 years (SD&#160;=&#160;0.7).\nWe assessed PVS computationally in the centrum semiovale and deep corona radiata on T2-weighted images. The computationally calculated measures were the total PVS volume and count per subject, and the mean individual PVS length, width and size, per subject. We assessed WMH by volume and visual Fazekas scores. We compared PVS visual rating to PVS computational metrics, and tested associations between each PVS measure and vascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol), vascular history (cardiovascular disease and stroke), and WMH burden, using generalized linear models, which we compared using coefficients, confidence intervals and model fit.\nIn 533 subjects, the computational PVS measures correlated positively with visual PVS ratings (PVS count r&#160;=&#160;0.59; PVS volume r&#160;=&#160;0.61; PVS mean length r&#160;=&#160;0.55; PVS mean width r&#160;=&#160;0.52; PVS mean size r&#160;=&#160;0.47). PVS size and width were associated with hypertension (OR 1.22, 95% CI [1.03 to 1.46] and 1.20, 95% CI [1.01 to 1.43], respectively), and stroke (OR 1.34, 95% CI [1.08 to 1.65] and 1.36, 95% CI [1.08 to 1.71], respectively). We found no association between other PVS measures and diabetes, hypercholesterolemia or cardiovascular disease history. Computational PVS volume, length, width and size were more strongly associated with WMH (PVS mean size versus WMH Fazekas score &#946;&#160;=&#160;0.66, 95% CI [0.59 to 0.74] and versus WMH volume &#946;&#160;=&#160;0.43, 95% CI [0.38 to 0.48]) than computational PVS count (WMH Fazekas score &#946;&#160;=&#160;0.21, 95% CI [0.11 to 0.3]; WMH volume &#946;&#160;=&#160;0.14, 95% CI [0.09 to 0.19]) or visual score. Individual PVS size showed the strongest association with WMH.\nComputational measures reflecting individual PVS size, length and width were more strongly associated with WMH, stroke and hypertension than computational count or visual PVS score. Multidimensional computational PVS metrics may increase sensitivity to detect associations of PVS with risk exposures, brain lesions and neurological disease, provide greater anatomic detail and accelerate understanding of disorders of brain fluid and waste clearance.",

        "abstract": "\nDietary supplements are expected to confer a smaller beneficial effect than medical treatments. Therefore, there is a need to develop cost-effective biomarkers that can demonstrate the efficacy of such supplements for carotid atherosclerosis. The aim of this study is to develop such a biomarker based on the changes of 376 plaque textural features measured from 3D ultrasound images.\nSince the number of features (376) was greater than the number of subjects (171) in this study, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of feature vectors. To generate a scalar biomarker for each subject, elements in the reduced feature vectors produced by PCA were weighted using locality preserving projections (LPP) to capture essential patterns exhibited locally in the feature space. 96 subjects treated by pomegranate juice and tablets, and 75 subjects receiving placebo-matching juice and tablets were evaluated in this study. The discriminative power of the proposed biomarker was evaluated and compared with existing biomarkers using t-tests. As the cost of a clinical trial is directly related to the number of subjects enrolled, the cost-effectiveness of the proposed biomarker was evaluated by sample size estimation.\nThe proposed biomarker was more able to discriminate plaque changes exhibited by the pomegranate and placebo groups than total plaque volume (TPV) according to the result of t-tests (TPV: p=0.34, Proposed biomarker: p=1.5&#215;10-5). The sample size required by the new biomarker to detect a significant effect was 20 times smaller than that required by TPV.\nWith the increase in cost-effectiveness afforded by the proposed biomarker, more proof-of-principle studies for novel treatment options could be performed.",

        "title": "Particulate emissions from L-Category vehicles towards Euro 5.",
        "abstract": "\nThe current experimental study presents particulate emissions from 30 Euro 1-4&#160;L-category vehicles (i.e. 2-, 3- and 4-wheelers such as mopeds, motorcycles, quads and minicars, registered in Europe between 2009 and 2016) tested on a chassis dynamometer. The objectives were to identify those sub-categories with high emissions, to assess whether the measures prescribed in the Euro 5 legislation will effectively control particulate emissions and finally to investigate the need for additional measures. The results showed that 2-stroke (2S) mopeds and diesel minicars comprised the vehicles with the highest particulate mass (PM) and solid particle number above 23&#160;nm (SPN23) emissions (up to 64&#160;mg/km and 4.5&#160;&#215;&#160;1013&#160;km-1, respectively). It is uncertain whether the installation of diesel particulate filters (DPF) is a cost-effective measure for diesel mini-cars in order to comply with Euro 5 standard, while advanced emission controls will be required for 2S mopeds, if such vehicles remain competitive for Euro 5. Regarding 4-stroke mopeds, motorcycles and quads, PM emissions were one order of magnitude lower than 2S ones and already below the Euro 5 limit. Nevertheless, SPN23 emissions from these sub-categories were up to 5 times higher than the Euro 6 passenger cars limit (6&#160;&#215;&#160;1011&#160;km-1). Even recent Euro 4 motorcycles exceeded this limit by up to 3 times. These results indicate that L-category vehicles are a significant contributor to vehicular particulate emissions and should be further monitored during and after the introduction of the Euro 5 step. Moreover, including SPN in the range 10-23&#160;nm increases emission levels by up to 2.4 times compared to SPN23, while volatile and semi-volatile particle numbers were even higher. Finally, cold engine operation was found to be a significant contributor on SPN23 emissions, especially for vehicles with lower overall emission levels. These results indicate that a specific particle number limit may be required for L-category to align emissions with passenger cars.",

Severity of liver fibrosis is used to determine prognoses for patients with NAFLD, but little is known about the relationship between liver fibrosis and CVEs in the real world.\nWe analyzed data from the prospective observational progression of liver damage and cardiometabolic disorders in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease study, comprising 898 consecutive outpatients (mean age, 56.4 &#177; 12.7 years; 37.5% women) screened for liver steatosis by ultrasound according to Hamagughi criteria. Liver fibrosis was defined as FIB-4 score greater than 2.67 and NAFLD fibrosis score greater than 0.676. After enrolment, patients were interviewed by phone every 6 months and examined every 12 months in the outpatient clinic, and CVEs were recorded (fatal or nonfatal ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction, cardiac or peripheral revascularization, new-onset arterial fibrillation and cardiovascular death). The primary outcomes were incidence rate of CVEs in patients with vs without NAFLD and factors associated with CVEs in patients with NAFLD.\nOver a median follow-up time of 41.4 months (3044.4 patient-years), 58 CVEs (1.9%/year) were registered. The rate of CVEs was higher in patients with (n = 643, 2.1%/year) vs without NAFLD (n = 255, 1.0%/year) (P = .066). In multivariable Cox proportional regression analysis, NAFLD increased risk for CVEs (hazard ratio [HR], 2.41; 95% CI, 1.06-5.47; P = .036), after adjustment for metabolic syndrome. Among patients with NAFLD, male sex, previous CVEs, metabolic syndrome and FIB-4 scores greater than 2.67 (HR, 4.02; 95% CI, 1.21-13.38; P = .023) were independently associated with risk of incident CVEs. NFS scores greater than 0.676 were also independently associated with risk of incident CVEs (HR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.05-5.27; P = .038).\nIn an analysis of data from a study of patients screened for NAFLD and followed, individuals with NAFLD had more than a 2-fold increase in risk of CVEs, and those with liver fibrosis had a 4-fold increase in risk. In patients with NAFLD, liver fibrosis indexes were independently associated with risk of incident CVEs. ClinicalTrials.gov no:NCT04036357.",

        "abstract": "\nTeriflunomide has been reported to inhibit microglial activation in experimental models of traumatic brain injury. However, its roles in ischemic stroke and underlying mechanisms of action are still undiscovered. In this study, we investigated the effects of teriflunomide on brain edema, neurologic deficits, infarct volume, neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and neurogenesis in a mouse model of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). tMCAO mice treated with teriflunomide showed lower brain water content on day 3, milder neurologic deficits and smaller infarct volume on day 7 than those treated with vehicle. Additionally, mice received teriflunomide had fewer activated Iba-1-positive microglia and lower protein levels of interleukin-1&#946; (IL-1&#946;), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and 3-Nitrotyrosine (3-NT) compared with those received vehicle on day 3. Further, teriflunomide alleviated Evans blue dye leakage, increased pericyte coverage and protein levels of platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB), platelet-derived growth factor receptor &#946; (PDGFR&#946;) and Bcl2, and decreased the number of PDGFR&#946;/matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9)-positive cells. Moreover, teriflunomide reduced the loss of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and occludin. Finally, teriflunomide significantly upregulated the number of 5-bromo-20-deoxyuridine (BrdU)/doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells and expression of mammalian achaete-scute homolog 1 (Mash1), DCX and Pbx1 in subventricular zone (SVZ) on day 7 after stroke.

The present study aimed to verify the efficiency of motor imagery based brain-computer interface (BCI) control of continuous passive motion (CPM) in the recovery of wrist extension due to stroke. An observational study was conducted in 26 chronic stroke patients, aged 49.0 &#177; 15.4 years, with upper extremity motor impairment. All patients showed no wrist extension recovery. A 24-channel highresolution electroencephalogram (EEG) system was used to acquire cortical signal while they were imagining extension of the affected wrist. Then, 20 sessions of BCI-driven CPM training were carried out for 6 weeks. Primary outcome was the increase of active range of motion (ROM) of the affected wrist from the baseline to final evaluation. Improvement of modified Barthel Index, EEG classification and motor imagery pattern of wrist extension were recorded as secondary outcomes. Twenty-one patients finally passed the EEG screening and completed all the BCI-driven CPM trainings. From baseline to the final evaluation, the increase of active ROM of the affected wrists was (24.05 &#177; 14.46)&#730;. The increase of modified Barthel Index was 3.10 &#177; 4.02 points. But no statistical difference was detected between the baseline and final evaluations (P > 0.05). Both EEG classification and motor imagery pattern improved.

        "title": "Does it still fit? - Adapting affordance judgments to altered body properties in young and older adults.",
        "abstract": "\nActor-related affordance judgments are decisions about potential actions that arise from environmental as well as bodily and cognitive conditions. The system can be challenged by sudden changes to otherwise rather stable actor references e.g. due to accidental bodily injuries or due to brain damage and resulting motor and cognitive constraints. The current study investigated adaptation to suddenly artificially altered body properties and its reversibility in healthy young versus older adults. Participants were asked to judge whether they would be able to fit their hand through a given horizontal opening (Aperture Task). Body alterations were induced by equipping participants with one hand splint for 24 hours that enlarged the hand in width and height. Participants were tested before and directly after putting the splint on as well as after a habituation period of 24 hours. To assess reversibility, participants were tested again directly after removing the splint and one day later. Judgment accuracy values and detection theory measures were reported. Both, young and older adults judged more conservatively when body properties were altered compared to initial judgments for normal body properties. Especially older adults showed major difficulties in such quick adaptation. Older adults' judgment accuracy as well as perceptual sensitivity were significantly lowered when body properties were suddenly altered. Importantly, lowered judgment performance occurred for both, the splinted as well as the non-splinted hand in older adults. Only after 24 hours of habituation, older adults tended to regain initial performance levels showing adaptive behavior to the altered condition. Removing the hand splint for one day was sufficient to reverse these adaptive effects. Our study results suggest that aging slows down adaptation to sudden bodily alterations affecting actor-related affordance judgments. We propose that these altered processes may go along with uncertainty and a heightened concern about potential consequences of misjudgments. Clearly, future studies are needed to further elucidate the underlying processes of adaptation in affordance judgments. These may reveal major implications for the aging society and its associated problems with an increased risk of falling or stroke related bodily constraints.",

Although the Hispanic population is the fastest-growing minority population in the United States, few studies have assessed whether the proportion of Hispanic residents in a neighborhood is associated with B-CPR delivery and survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. We assessed whether B-CPR rates and survival vary by neighborhood-level ethnicity. We hypothesized that neighborhoods with a higher proportion of Hispanic residents have lower B-CPR rates and lower survival.\nWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Epistry at US sites. Neighborhoods were classified by census tract based on percentage of Hispanic residents: <25%, 25% to 50%, 51% to 75%, or >75%. We independently modeled the likelihood of receipt of B-CPR and survival by neighborhood-level ethnicity controlling for site and patient-level confounding characteristics.\nFrom 2011 to 2015, the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium collected 27 481 US arrest events; after excluding pediatric arrests, emergency medical services-witnessed arrests, or arrests occurring in a healthcare or institutional facility, 18 927 were included. B-CPR was administered in 37% of events. In neighborhoods with <25% Hispanic residents, B-CPR was administered in 39% of events, whereas it was administered in 27% of events in neighborhoods with >75% Hispanic residents. Compared with <25% Hispanic neighborhoods in a multivariable analysis, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods had lower B-CPR rates (51% to 75% Hispanic: odds ratio, 0.79 [CI, 0.65-0.95], P=0.014; >75% Hispanic: odds ratio, 0.72 [CI, 0.55-0.96], P=0.025) and lower survival rates (global P value 0.029; >75% Hispanic: odds ratio, 0.56 [CI, 0.34-0.93], P=0.023).\nIndividuals with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods were less likely to receive B-CPR and had lower likelihood of survival.

        "abstract": "\nTiming and indication for pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) in patients with repaired Tetralogy of Fallot (rToF) and pulmonary regurgitation (PR) are uncertain. To improve understanding of pumping mechanics, we investigated atrioventricular coupling before and after surgical PVR. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance was performed in patients (n = 12) with rToF and PR > 35% before and after PVR and in healthy controls (n = 15). Atrioventricular plane displacement (AVPD), global longitudinal peak systolic strain (GLS), atrial and ventricular volumes, and caval blood flows were analyzed. Right ventricular (RV) AVPD and RV free wall GLS were lower in patients before PVR compared with controls (P < 0.0001; P < 0.01) and decreased after PVR (P < 0.0001 for both). Left ventricular AVPD was lower in patients before PVR compared with controls (P < 0.05) and decreased after PVR (P < 0.01). Left ventricular GLS did not differ between patients and controls (P > 0.05). Right atrial reservoir volume and RV stroke volume generated by AVPD correlated in controls (r&#8201;=&#8201;0.93; P < 0.0001) and patients before PVR (r&#8201;=&#8201;0.88; P < 0.001) but not after PVR. In conclusion, there is a clear atrioventricular coupling in patients before PVR that is lost after PVR, possibly because of loss of pericardial integrity. Impaired atrioventricular coupling complicates assessment of ventricular function after surgery using measurements of longitudinal function. Changes in atrioventricular coupling seen in patients with rToF may be energetically unfavorable, and long-term effects of surgery on atrioventricular coupling is therefore of interest. Also, AVPD and GLS cannot be used interchangeably to assess longitudinal function in rToF.NEW & NOTEWORTHY There is a clear atrioventricular coupling in patients with Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) and pulmonary regurgitation before surgical pulmonary valve replacement (PVR) that is lost after operation, possibly because of loss of pericardial integrity. The impaired atrioventricular coupling complicates assessment of ventricular function after surgery when using measurements of longitudinal function. Left ventricular atrioventricular plane displacement (AVPD) found differences between patients and controls and changes after PVR that longitudinal strain could not detect. This indicates that AVPD and strain cannot be used interchangeably to assess longitudinal function in repaired ToF.",

        "abstract": "\nRight ventricle (RV) pressure loading can lead to RV fibrosis and dysfunction. We previously found increased RV, septal hinge-point and left ventricle (LV) fibrosis in experimental RV pressure loading. However, the relation of RV wall stress to biventricular fibrosis and dysfunction is incompletely defined. Rabbits underwent progressive pulmonary artery banding (PAB) over 3 wk with hemodynamics, echocardiography, and myocardial samples obtained at a terminal experiment at 6 wk. An additional group received PAB and treatment with an endothelin receptor antagonist. The endocardial and epicardial borders of short-axis echo images were traced and analyzed with invasive pressures to yield regional end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) wall stress. To increase clinical translation, computer model-derived wall stress was compared with Laplace wall stress. The relation of wall stress with fibrosis (picrosirius red staining) and ventricular function was analyzed. ED wall stress in all regions and RV and LV free-wall ES wall stress were increased in PAB rabbits versus sham animals. Laplace wall stress correlated well with computational models. In PAB, fibrosis was highest in the RV free wall, then septal hinge regions, and lowest in the septum and LV free wall. Fibrosis was moderately related to ED (r&#8201;=&#8201;0.47, P = 0.0011), but not ES wall stress. RV ED wall stress was strongly related to echo indexes of function (strain rate: r&#8201;=&#8201;0.71, P = 0.048; E', r&#8201;=&#8201;-0.75, P = 0.0077; tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion: r&#8201;=&#8201;0.85, P = 0.0038) and RV fractional area change (r&#8201;=&#8201;0.77, P = 0.027). ED, more than ES, wall stress is related moderately to fibrosis and strongly to function in experimental RV pressure loading, especially at the septal hinge-point regions, where fibrosis is prominent. This suggests that wall stress partially links RV pressure loading, fibrosis, and dysfunction and may be useful to follow clinically.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Biventricular fibrosis and dysfunction impact outcomes in RV pressure loading, but their relation to wall stress is poorly defined. Using a pulmonary artery band rabbit model, we entered echocardiography and catheter data into a computer model to yield regional end-diastolic (EDWS) and end-systolic (ESWS) wall stress. EDWS, more than ESWS, correlated with fibrosis and dysfunction, especially at the fibrosis-intense septal hinge-point regions. Thus, wall stress may be clinically useful in linking RV pressure loading to regional fibrosis and dysfunction.",

Our article describes the methodology (recording, processing and interpretation) used in a diagnostic/phenotypic hand tremor study conducted in our lab at the Human Motor Control Section of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), at the National Institutes of Health. The necessary equipment includes two one-axis accelerometers and four-channel electromyography (EMG). The hand tremor is recorded at rest, posture with and without weight loading, and during movement (kinetic). The recorded signals are analyzed in the time and frequency domains. The characterization of the dominant frequencies in the accelerometers and their relationship with the EMG frequencies are essential for the differential diagnosis of different tremor syndromes. We describe the electrophysiological characteristics of several tremor syndromes such as enhanced physiological tremor, essential tremor, Parkinson tremor, pharmacological-induced tremor, orthostatic tremor, and functional (psychogenic) tremor. Simplified guidance for adoption of tremor studies as a clinical tool in a movement disorders subspecialty clinic is provided.",

Data on the modifiable factors contributing to the recurrence of stroke in type 2 diabetic Malaysian population with a history of stroke stratified by genders are lacking, and this supports the importance of this study.\nThe data of 4622 patients with T2DM who had a history of stroke was obtained from the Malaysian National Stroke Registry. Univariate analysis was performed to differentiate between genders with and without stroke recurrence in terms of demographics, first stroke attack presentations, and other clinical characteristics. The significant factors determined from the univariate analysis were further investigated using logistic regression.\nIschemic heart diseases were found significantly associated with the stroke recurrence in males (OR = 1.738; 95% CI: 1.071-2.818) as well as female (OR = 5.859; 95% CI: 2.469-13.752) diabetic patients. The duration of hypertension, as well as the duration of diabetes, has been associated with the recurrence in both male and female subjects (p value < 0.05). Smoking status has an impact on the stroke recurrence in male subjects, while no significant association was observed among their peers.\nMost of the predictive factors contributing to the recurrence of stroke in type 2 diabetic Malaysian population with a history of stroke are modifiable, in which IHD was the most prominent risk factor in both genders. The impact of optimizing the management of IHD as well as blood glucose control on stroke recurrence may need to be elucidated.

A prospective study of Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes was performed to evaluate the relationship between NC and cardiovascular disease.\nA multicenter prospective study with eight-year follow-up was conducted in Beijing communities. Cardiovascular events were defined as myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, hospitalization for heart failure, coronary revascularization, cardiac death, stroke, transient ischemic attack, and cerebral hemorrhage.\nA total of 3,009 diabetic patients were recruited. Following an eight-year follow-up, 211 patients with cardiovascular events (105 in men and 106 in women) were identified. All patients were categorized into two groups according to the upper quartile of NC (43&#8201;cm in men and 39&#8201;cm in women). The prevalence of cardiovascular events in men with an NC&#8201;>43&#8201;cm (16.48%) was higher than that in the group with an NC&#8201;<43&#8201;cm (8.16%, p=0.007).

Recent studies suggest chronic hypoperfusion in patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD) has analogous effects. We hypothesized a positive correlation between the severity of chronic hypoperfusion and the extent of neuroprotection. To determine if this correlation exists, we compared stroke volumes and clinical measures of modified ranking scale (mRS) and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) between cases with and without PVD, subgrouping PVD cases by ankle-brachial-index (ABI) values. Patients and methods Cases of ischemic stroke with and without PVD were sampled retrospectively from a local institutional data base. Charts were manually reviewed for demographics (age, sex, ethnicity), comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, smoking, and stroke history), clinical measures (admission NIHSS, prior mRS, three-month mRS, and survival) and stroke volumes in each case. Those diagnosed with PVD and ABI indicating active disease were grouped as PVD cases; those not diagnosed with PVD or having ABI indicating absence of disease were used as controls. PVD cases were subgrouped by disease severity per ABI values: mild (ABI 0.8-0.9), moderate (ABI 0.5-0.9) and severe (ABI < 0.5). Data were analyzed in R using adjusted logarithmic-multivariate models. Adjusted cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations between survival and PVD. Results A total of 105 patients, 50 PVD cases and 55 controls, were collected. Mean age was 72.54 years, 51.4% were males and 48.6% females, and 94% were Caucasian. There were 17 mild, 22 moderate, and 11 severe cases of PVD. A higher incidence of comorbidities was present in PVD cases. The mean admission NIHSS was 4.44 and did not differ significantly between groups. Stroke volumes were significantly lower (p = .021) in PVD cases (4.39 &#177; 8.97 ml) compared to controls (19.33&#160;&#177; 44.31 ml).

The lowered levels of Ox-LDL and LOX-1 in AG-administered rats deem it to be a potent antihypercholesterolemic agent. Compared to AV, AG had a pronounced effect in downregulating the expression of lipids evidenced by Oil Red O staining. AG binds with LOX-1 at a higher affinity validated by docking.\nThis study validates AG to be an effective stratagem in bringing down the lipid stress induced by HCD and can be deemed as an antihypercholesterolemic agent.",

Up to date, no studies investigated the role of exercise training-based cardiac rehabilitation (ET-CR) programs on &#946;OHB levels. Therefore, the present study is aimed at investigating whether a supervised 4-week ET-CR program was able to induce changes in Sirt1 activity and &#946;OHB levels and to evaluate the possible relationship between such parameters, in Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF) patients.\nA prospective longitudinal observational study was conducted on patients consecutively admitted to the Cardiology and Cardiac Rehabilitation Units of \"San Gennaro dei Poveri\" Hospital in Naples, Italy. In fifty elderly patients affected by HFpEF, in NYHA II and III class, Sirt1 activity, Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC), &#946;OHB, and Oxidized Low-Density Lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) levels were measured before and at the end of the ET-CR program. A control group of 20 HFpEF patients was also recruited, and the same parameters were evaluated 4 weeks after the beginning of the study.\nET-CR induced an increase of Sirt1 activity, &#946;OHB levels, and antioxidant capacity. Moreover, it was associated with a rise in NAD+ and NAD+/NADH ratio levels and a reduction in Ox-LDL. No changes affected the controls.\nThe characterization of the ET-CR effects from a metabolic viewpoint might represent an important step to improve the HFpEF management.",

        "abstract": "\nStroke is one of the major causes of death and long-term disability worldwide; the associated breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) aggravates ischemic brain damage. Accordingly, many medicinal herbs and formulas have been used to treat stroke-related symptoms. In this study, we selected two Korean herbal medicine formulas, Weisheng-tang and Tongxuewan, through Dongeuibogam text-mining analysis, and evaluated their protective effect on BBB disruption and brain damage in stroke. Ischemic brain damage was induced in mice by photothrombotic cortical ischemia. The infarct volume, brain edema, neurological deficits, and motor function 24&#8201;h after ischemic injury were analyzed. We investigated BBB breakdown by measuring Evans blue extravasation in addition to endothelial cells, tight junction proteins, protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) using immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. Pretreatment with Weisheng-tang significantly reduced infarct volume and edema and improved neurological and motor functions; however, Tongxuewan did not. In addition, Weisheng-tang decreased brain infarction and edema and recovered neurological and motor deficit in a dose-dependent manner (30, 100, and 300&#8201;mg/kg). Weisheng-tang pretreatment resulted in significantly less BBB damage and higher brain microvasculature after focal cerebral ischemia. Tight junction proteins, such as zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and claudin-5, were preserved in Weisheng-tang-pretreated mice. Moreover, the ischemic brain in these mice showed suppressed PAR-1 and MMP-9 expression. In conclusion, our findings show that Weisheng-tang, which was selected through literature analysis but has not previously been used as a stroke remedy, exerts protective effects against ischemic brain damage and suggest its possible application for potential stroke patients, especially in the elderly.",

As scar burden predicts response to stem cell therapy, we sought to explore a correlation between gal-3 and response to CD34+ cell transplantation in patients with CHF.\nWe performed a post hoc analysis of patients, enrolled in 2 prospective trials investigating the clinical effects of CD34+ cell therapy in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICMP) and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP). CD34+ cells were mobilized by G-CSF, collected via apheresis, and injected transendocardially using NOGA system. Patients were followed for 3 months and demographic, echocardiographic, and biochemical parameters and gal-3 were analyzed at baseline and at follow-up. Response to cell therapy was defined as an LVEF increase of &#8805;5%.\n61 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age of patients was 52 years and 83% were male. DCMP and ICMP were present in 69% and 31% of patients, respectively. The average serum creatinine was 86 &#177; 23&#160;&#956;mol/L, NT-proBNP 1132 (IQR 350-2279) pg/mL, and LVEF 30 &#177; 6%.

After screening out miRNA-324-5p, its level in peripheral blood of stroke patients and in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced primary rat neurons was determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Regulatory effects of miRNA-324-5p on viability, and apoptosis of OGD-induced neurons were evaluated by CCK-8 and Annexin V fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) staining, respectively. Glucose uptake and caspase-3 activity in OGD-induced neurons transfected with miRNA-324-5p mimics or inhibitor were also examined. The binding of miRNA-324-5p to its target gene RAN was analyzed by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay and western blot analysis. By analyzing the data of GSE46266 profile, miRNA-324-5p expression was shown markedly lower in MCAO rats relative to controls. Identically, we also observed the downregulated miRNA-324-5p in peripheral blood of stroke patients and in vitro OGD-induced primary neurons. Overexpression of miRNA-324-5p accelerated viability, induced apoptosis and strengthened glucose uptake ability of OGD-induced neurons. Knockdown of miRNA-324-5p, conversely, obtained the opposite results. Furthermore, we confirmed the binding of miRNA-324-5p to RAN, the target gene that was negatively regulated by miRNA-324-5p. Importantly, RAN overexpression partially reversed the regulatory effect of miRNA-324-5p on viability and glucose uptake of OGD-induced neurons. miRNA-324-5p is downregulated after ischemic stroke, which aggravates the disease condition by inhibiting neuronal proliferation and glucose uptake via upregulating RAN.",

Therefore, angiogenesis has been a focus of CIS research in recent years. The present study aimed to investigate the expression of microRNA (miR)-221 in patients with CIS and to explore the effect of miR-221 on endothelial cell function. The level of miR-221 was detected using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The relationship between miR-221 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) was predicted and confirmed by bioinformatics and dual luciferase reporter assay. Cell viability, migration and invasion, and cell apoptosis were determined using MTT assay, Transwell assay and flow cytometry respectively. Tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was determined by performing the tube formation assay. In addition, protein levels were measured using western blot analysis. The results of the current study indicated that miR-221 levels were significantly decreased in the peripheral blood of patients with CIS. PTEN was confirmed to be a direct target of miR-221. Downregulation of miR-221 significantly inhibited the function of HUVECs as evidenced by the decreased cell viability, migration and invasion with increased cell apoptosis and tube formation inhibition. miR-221 upregulation produced the reverse effects, whilst all the effects of miR-221 upregulation on HUVECs were reversed by PTEN overexpression. The PI3K/AKT pathway was identified to be involved in the regulation of miR-221 on HUVECs. In conclusion, miR-221 was downregulated in CIS patients, and it promoted the function of HUVECs by regulating the PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway in vitro, suggesting the ability to promote angiogenesis. Therefore, miR-221 may be a novel and promising therapeutic target for CIS treatment.",

Interestingly, there may be racial differences in the presentation and subsequent prognostication of treatment of moyamoya. It is diagnosed with classic angiographic findings of stenosis or occlusion of the circle of Willis vessels. Here, we describe a 28-year-old Caucasian female who was initially diagnosed with anxiety when she presented with symptoms of impaired concentration and fatigue. After the development of remitting slurred speech and facial droop, magnetic resonance imaging and cerebral angiogram yielded the discovery of high-grade stenosis of the origin of the left middle cerebral artery with associated thrombosis in that area. She did well after getting surgery and rehabilitation. This demonstrates a unique presentation of prominent psychiatric symptoms initially thought to be anxiety and culminated in the finding of ischemic stroke in an adult patient with moyamoya.",

This study compared the effect of TCI propofol and sevoflurane on intraoperative hemodynamic profile in kidney transplant patients.\nA single-blinded prospective study was performed in 46 kidney transplant recipients who were randomized into receiving TCI propofol or sevoflurane as anesthetics maintenance. Hemodynamic parameters such as mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume index (SVI), and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) were measured at baseline before induction, postintubation, first surgical incision, every 15 minutes after the first incision, reperfusion, and 15 minutes after reperfusion.

Calycosin-7-O-&#946;-D-glucoside (CG) is a representative component of isoflavones in Radix Astragali (RA). Previous studies have shown that CG has potential neuroprotective effects. However, whether CG alleviates neuronal apoptosis through antioxidant stress after ischemia-reperfusion remains unknown. To investigate the positive effects of CG on oxidative stress and apoptosis of neurons, we simulated the ischemia-reperfusion process in vitro using an immortalized hippocampal neuron cell line (HT22) and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) model. CG significantly improved cell viability and reduced oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis. In addition, CG treatment upregulated the expression of SIRT1, FOXO1, PGC-1&#945;, and Bcl-2 and downregulated the expression of Bax.

This study investigates the beneficial effects of ALA on myocardial injury and organ damage caused by experimental HS and further explores its underlying mechanism. Male Wistar rats were exposed to 42&#176;C until their rectal core temperature reached 42.9&#176;C and ALA was pretreared 40 or 80&#8201;mg/kg (i.v.) 1.5&#8201;h prior to heat exposure. Results showed that HS-induced lethality and hypothermia were significantly alleviated by ALA treatment that also improved plasma levels of CRE, LDH, and CPK and myocardial injury biomarkers myoglobin and troponin. In addition, ALA reduced cardiac superoxide anion formation and protein expression of cleaved caspase 3 caused by HS. Proinflammatory cytokine TNF-&#945; and NF-&#954;B pathways were significantly reduced by ALA treatment which may be associated with the upregulation of Hsp70. ALA significantly increased the Atg5-12 complex and LC3B II/LC3B I ratio, whereas the p62 and p-mTOR expression was attenuated in HS rats, indicating the activation of autophagy by ALA. In conclusion, ALA ameliorated the deleterious effects of HS by exerting antioxidative and anti-inflammatory capacities.

Detection of arrhythmia is often challenging if symptoms occur when patients have no chance for immediate electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnostic testing, or if the observation time period is short or an immediate visit to their doctor is not possible. Smartwatches and other wearable devices are able to record a single lead ECG recording, but a single lead ECG is often not sufficient for diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders. Even diagnosis of AF can be difficult with only information from a single lead bipolar ECG. Some smart devices use photoplethysmography for detection of cardiac rhythm, but this technique can only give indirect hints of the underlying cardiac rhythm, is prone to interferences, and cannot be used for detection of myocardial ischemia. A three-lead bipolar ECG like the Einthoven leads used in regular ECGs can add useful information concerning arrhythmia detection or even diagnosis of other cardiovascular diseases like ischemia.

However, the use of cell therapy is accompanied by adverse effects, so research is growing to use cell-free extracts such as extracellular vesicles (EVs) for targeting brain diseases. In the current study, male Wistar albino rats (20&#8201;months old) were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Then, EVs (30&#8201;&#956;g) were injected at 2&#8201;hours after stroke onset via an intracerebroventricular (ICV) route. Measurements were done at day 7 post-MCAO. EVs administration reduced lesion volume and steadily improved spontaneous locomotor activity. EVs administration also reduced microgliosis (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1)+ cells) and apoptotic (terminal-deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated nick end labelling [TUNEL]) positive cells and increased neuronal survival (neuronal nuclear (NeuN)+ cells) in the ischemic boundary zone (IBZ). However, it had no effect on neurogenesis within the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) but decreased cellular migration toward the IBZ (doublecortin (DCX)+ cells). The results of this study showed neuroprotective and restorative mechanisms of NSC-EVs administration, which may offer new avenues for therapeutic intervention of brain ischemia. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Based on our results, EVs administration can effectively reduce microglial density and neuronal apoptosis, thereby steadily improves functional recovery after MCAO. These findings provide the beneficial effect of NSC-EVs as a new biological treatment for stroke.",

This essay examines over a century's worth of medical case studies and other narratives describing neurological reading deficits in order to determine what impact those deficits had on people's lives, well-being, and sense of identity in societies increasingly defined by the ability to read. The complex responses to what this essay calls postliteracy suggest the value of taking into account neurological differences when documenting the history of reading. Drawing on neurocognitive and disability studies, this essay directs attention to the testimonies of individuals with alexia to better understand what it feels like to lose the ability to read at a time when reading is figured as a crucial aspect of our identities; a signifier of status, privilege, and power; and even a prerequisite to leading a meaningful life.",

        "abstract": "\nA fraction of patients with penetrating artery infarction (PAI) experience progressive motor deficit deterioration (PMD). We sought to investigate the role of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) at admission in predicting PMD.\nFrom January 2015 to September 2018, consecutive patients with PAI from three centers were prospectively enrolled in this study. PMD was defined as worsening of motor function score by &#8805;1 point on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale during the first 5&#8201;days after admission. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the relationship between hs-CRP and PMD in patients with PAI. We also performed receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and constructed a nomogram to assess the overall discriminative ability of hs-CRP in predicting PMD.\nWe ultimately included 544 patients (mean age, 65.4&#8201;&#177;&#8201;11.8&#8201;years). A total of 85 (15.6%) patients were identified to have PMD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hs-CRP was independently associated with PMD (P&#8201;=&#8201;0.001). The optimal cutoff value for hs-CRP as a predictor for PMD was 3.48&#8201;mg/L, with a sensitivity of 73.64% and a specificity of 82.35% (area under curve, 0.792).

The purpose of this study was to explore predictive indicators of the in-hospital mortality of LHI patients treated conservatively without decompressive hemicraniectomy.\nWe performed a retrospective study of 187 consecutive patients with LHI between January 1, 2016 to May 31, 2019. The receiver operating curves were preformed to evaluate predictive performance of demographics factors, biomarkers and radiologic characteristics. Significant prognostic factors were combined to build a nomogram to predict the risk of in-hospital death of individual patients.\nOne hundred fifty-eight patients with LHI were finally enrolled, 58 of which died. Through multivariate logistic regression analysis, we identified that independent prognostic factors for in-hospital death were age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]&#8201;=&#8201;1.066; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.025-1.108; P&#8201;=&#8201;0.001), midline shift (MLS, aOR&#8201;=&#8201;1.330, 95% CI, 1.177-1.503; P&#8201;<&#8201;&#160;0.001), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR, aOR&#8201;=&#8201;3.319, 95% CI, 1.542-7.144; P&#8201;=&#8201;0.002). NLR may serve as a better predictor than white blood count (WBC) and neutrophil counts. Lastly, we used all of the clinical characteristics to establish a nomogram for predicting the prognosis, area under the curve (AUC) of this nomogram was 0.858 (95% CI, 0.794-0.908).\nThis study shows that age, MLS, and admission NLR value are independent predictors of in-hospital mortality in patients with LHI.

        "abstract": "\nBackground and Purpose- Stroke is the leading cause of disability in United States, and aphasia is a common sequela after a left hemisphere stroke. Functional imaging and brain stimulation studies show that right hemisphere structures are detrimental to aphasia recovery but evidence from diffusion tensor imaging is lacking. We investigated the role of homologous language pathways in naming recovery after left hemispheric stroke. Methods- Patients with aphasia after a left hemispheric stroke underwent naming assessment using the Boston Naming Test and diffusion tensor imaging at the acute and chronic time points. We analyzed diffusion tensor imaging of right arcuate fasciculus and frontal aslant tracts. We used Wilcoxon rank-sum test to evaluate structural lateralization patterns and partial Spearman correlation/multivariate generalized linear model to determine the role of right arcuate fasciculus and frontal aslant tracts in naming recovery after controlling for confounders. Results were corrected for multiple comparisons. Results- On average, the structural integrity of left language pathways deteriorated more than their right homologs, such that there was rightward lateralization in the chronic stage. Regression/correlation analyses showed that greater preservation of tract integrity of right arcuate fasciculus was associated with poorer naming recovery. Conclusions- Our study provides preliminary evidence that preservation of right homologs of language pathways is associated with poor recovery of naming after a left hemispheric stroke, consistent with previous evidence that maintaining greater reliance on left hemisphere structures is associated with better language recovery.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground and Purpose- There are scarce data regarding the safety of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in acute ischemic stroke among patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs). Methods- We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the current literature. Data regarding all adult patients pretreated with DOAC who received IVT for acute ischemic stroke were recorded. Meta-analysis was performed by comparing the rate of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage in these patients with (1) stroke patients without prior anticoagulation therapy and (2) patients on warfarin with international normalized ratio <1.7. Meta-analyses were further conducted in subgroups as follows: (1) administration of DOAC within 48 hours versus an unknown interval before IVT, (2) consideration of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage outcome according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders (NINDS) versus the European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study II (ECASS-II) criteria. Results- After reviewing 13&#8201;392 reports and communicating with certain authors of 12 published studies, a total of 52&#8201;823 acute ischemic stroke patients from 6 studies were enrolled in the present meta-analysis: DOACs: 366, warfarin: 2133, and 503&#8201;241 patients without prior anticoagulation. We detected no additional risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage following IVT among patients taking DOACs within 48 hours-DOACs-warfarin: NINDS (odds ratio [OR], 0.55 [95% CI, 0.19-1.59]), ECASS-II (OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.28-2.16]); DOACs-no-anticoagulation: NINDS (OR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.46-3.31]), ECASS-II (OR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.32-2.41]). Similarly, no additional risk was detected with no time limit between last DOAC intake-DOACs warfarin: NINDS (OR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.49-1.45]), ECASS-II (OR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.67-1.85]); DOACs-no-anticoagulation: NINDS (OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 0.43-3.15]), ECASS-II (OR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.33-2.41]). There was no evidence of heterogeneity across included studies (I2=0%). We also provided the details of 123 individual cases with or without reversal agents before IVT. There was no significant increase in the risk of hemorrhagic transformation (OR, 1.48 [95% CI, 0.50-4.38]), symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation (OR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.09-2.55]), or early mortality (OR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.11-3.43]) between cohorts who did or did not receive prethrombolysis idarucizumab.

        "abstract": "\nBackground and Purpose- The aim of this study was to explore clinical and radiological prognostic factors for long-term swallowing recovery in patients with poststroke dysphagia and to develop and validate a prognostic model using a machine learning algorithm. Methods- Consecutive patients (N=137) with acute ischemic stroke referred for swallowing examinations were retrospectively reviewed. Dysphagia was monitored in the 6 months poststroke period and then analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model for clinical and radiological factors. Bayesian network models were developed using potential prognostic factors to classify patients into those with good (no need for tube feeding or diet modification for 6 months) and poor (tube feeding or diet modification for 6 months) recovery of swallowing function. Results- Twenty-four (17.5%) patients showed persistent dysphagia for the first 6 months with a mean duration of 65.6 days. The time duration of poststroke dysphagia significantly differed by tube feeding status, clinical dysphagia scale, sex, severe white matter hyperintensities, and bilateral lesions at the corona radiata, basal ganglia, or internal capsule (CR/BG/IC). Among these factors, tube feeding status (P<0.001), bilateral lesions at CR/BG/IC (P=0.001), and clinical dysphagia scale (P=0.042) were significant prognostic factors in a multivariate analysis using Cox regression models. The tree-augmented network classifier, based on 10 factors (sex, lesions at CR, BG/IC, and insula, laterality, anterolateral territory of the brain stem, bilateral lesions at CR/BG/IC, severe white matter hyperintensities, clinical dysphagia scale, and tube feeding status), performed better than other benchmarking classifiers developed in this study. Conclusions- Initial dysphagia severity and bilateral lesions at CR/BG/IC are revealed to be significant prognostic factors for 6-month swallowing recovery. The prediction of 6-month swallowing recovery was feasible based on clinical and radiological factors using the Bayesian network model. We emphasize the importance of bilateral subcortical lesions as prognostic factors that can be utilized to develop prediction models for long-term swallowing recovery.",

        "title": "New Endovascular Approach for Hypothermia With Intrajugular Cooling and Neuroprotective Effect in Ischemic Stroke.",
        "abstract": "\nBackground and Purpose- Induction of hypothermia as a stroke therapy has been limited by logistical challenges. This study was designed to determine the hypothermic and neuroprotective efficacy of infusing cold saline directly into the internal jugular (IJ) vein and compare the effects of IJ hypothermia to those achieved by intracarotid artery hypothermia in an ischemic stroke model. Methods- The right middle cerebral artery was occluded in rats using an intraluminal filament. Immediately following reperfusion, hypothermia was achieved by infusing isotonic saline through microcatheter into the right IJ or right intracarotid over 30 minutes. Infarct sizes, neurological deficits, blood-brain barrier damage, edema volume, blood-brain barrier associated molecules (MMP-9 [matrix metallopeptidase 9] and AQP-4 [aquaporin 4]), and apoptosis-associated proteins (Bcl-2 and cleaved Caspase-3) were measured. Results- We found that both IJ- and intracarotid-based infusion cooled the brain robustly with a minimal effect on rectal temperatures. This brain cooling led to significantly reduced infarct volumes at 24 hours after reperfusion, as well as decreased expression of the proapoptotic protein cleaved Caspase-3 and increased expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Intracarotid and IJ cooling also aided in blood-brain barrier maintenance, as shown by decreased edema volumes, reduced Evans Blue leakage, and decreased expression of edema-facilitating proteins (MMP-9 and AQP-4). Both cooling methods then translated to preserved neurological function as determined by multiple functional tests over a 28-day observation period. Most importantly, the cooling and neuroprotective efficacy of IJ cooling was comparable to intracarotid cooling by almost every metric evaluated. Conclusions- Compared with intracarotid infusion, IJ infusion conferred a similar degree of hypothermia and neuroprotection following ischemic stroke. Given the ease of establishing vascular access via the internal jugular vein and the powerful neuroprotection that hypothermia provides, IJ brain cooling could be used as a promising hypothermia-induction modality going forward.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground and Purpose- Selection of patients with acute ischemic stroke for endovascular treatment generally relies on dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography perfusion. Dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging requires injection of contrast, whereas computed tomography perfusion requires high doses of ionizing radiation. The purpose of this work was to develop and evaluate a deep learning (DL)-based algorithm for assisting the selection of suitable patients with acute ischemic stroke for endovascular treatment based on 3-dimensional pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL). Methods- A total of 167 image sets of 3-dimensional pCASL data from 137 patients with acute ischemic stroke scanned on 1.5T and 3.0T Siemens MR systems were included for neural network training. The concurrently acquired dynamic susceptibility contrast magnetic resonance imaging was used to produce labels of hypoperfused brain regions, analyzed using commercial software. The DL and 6 machine learning (ML) algorithms were trained with 10-fold cross-validation. The eligibility for endovascular treatment was determined retrospectively based on the criteria of perfusion/diffusion mismatch in the DEFUSE 3 trial (Endovascular Therapy Following Imaging Evaluation for Ischemic Stroke). The trained DL algorithm was further applied on twelve 3-dimensional pCASL data sets acquired on 1.5T and 3T General Electric MR systems, without fine-tuning of parameters. Results- The DL algorithm can predict the dynamic susceptibility contrast-defined hypoperfusion region in pCASL with a voxel-wise area under the curve of 0.958, while the 6 ML algorithms ranged from 0.897 to 0.933. For retrospective determination for subject-level endovascular treatment eligibility, the DL algorithm achieved an accuracy of 92%, with a sensitivity of 0.89 and specificity of 0.95. When applied to the GE pCASL data, the DL algorithm achieved a voxel-wise area under the curve of 0.94 and a subject-level accuracy of 92% for endovascular treatment eligibility. Conclusions- pCASL perfusion magnetic resonance imaging in conjunction with the DL algorithm provides a promising approach for assisting decision-making for endovascular treatment in patients with acute ischemic stroke.",

We compared effects of BP and end-tidal carbon dioxide (etCO2) on middle cerebral artery mean flow velocity (MFV) in consecutive transient ischemic attack and minor stroke patients. Methods- In the population-based, prospective OXVASC (Oxford Vascular Study) phenotyped cohort, change in MFV on transcranial Doppler ultrasound (&#916;MFV, DWL-DopplerBox), beat-to-beat BP (Finometer), and etCO2 was measured during 30 seconds of BH or hyperventilation. Two blinded reviewers independently assessed recording quality. Dependence of &#916;MFV on &#916;BP and &#916;etCO2 was determined by general linear models, stratified by quartiles. Results- Four hundred eighty-eight of 602 (81%) patients with adequate bone windows had high-quality recordings, more often in younger participants (64.6 versus 68.7 years; P<0.01), whereas 426 had hyperventilation tests (70.7%). During BH, &#916;MFV was correlated with a rise in mean blood pressure (MBP; r2=0.15, P<0.001) but not &#916;CO2 (r2=0.002, P=0.32), except in patients with &#916;MBP <10% (r2=0.13, P<0.001). In contrast during hyperventilation, the fall in MFV was similarly correlated with reduction in CO2 and reduction in MBP (&#916;CO2: r2=0.13, P<0.001; &#916;MBP: r2=0.12, P<0.001), with a slightly greater effect of &#916;CO2 when &#916;MBP was <10% (r2=0.15). Stratifying by quartile, MFV increased linearly during BH across quartiles of &#916;MBP, with no increase with &#916;etCO2. In contrast, during hyperventilation, MFV decreased linearly with &#916;etCO2, independent of &#916;MBP. Conclusions- In older patients with recent transient ischemic attack or minor stroke, cerebral blood flow responses to BH were confounded by BP changes but reflected etCO2 change during hyperventilation. Correct interpretation of cerebrovascular reactivity responses to etCO2, including in small vessel disease and carotid stenosis, requires concurrent BP measurement.",

        "title": "Implementation of High-Intensity Stepping Training During Inpatient Stroke Rehabilitation Improves Functional Outcomes.",
        "abstract": "\nBackground and Purpose- Therapeutic strategies that capitalize on the intrinsic capacity for neurological recovery early poststroke to improve locomotion are uncertain. Emerging data suggest that task-specific stepping practice provided at higher cardiovascular intensities may be critical dosage parameters that could maximize locomotor recovery. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the comparative effectiveness of providing high-intensity training on locomotor capacity early poststroke as compared with usual care. Methods- A quasi-experimental design was used to compare changes in stepping activity (StepWatch), walking, and balance outcomes during usual care (n=56) versus high-intensity stepping intervention (n=54) in inpatient stroke patients. Primary outcomes assessed weekly included self-selected and fastest gait speed, 6-minute walk test, and the Berg Balance Scale, with secondary outcomes of Swedish Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke-Norwegian version, Functional Ambulation Category, 30-s sit-to-stand, strength (average manual muscle testing), and Barthel Index. Regression analyses identified relationships between demographics, baseline function, and training activities (steps per day; duration achieved, 70%-85% maximum heart rates) and primary outcomes at discharge. Results- Following implementation of high-intensity stepping, average steps per day (5777&#177;2784) were significantly greater than during usual care (3917&#177;2656; P<0.001). Statistically different and clinically meaningful changes in self-selected speed (0.39&#177;0.28 versus 0.16&#177;0.26 m/s) and fastest gait speed (0.47&#177;0.41 versus 0.17&#177;0.38 m/s; both P<0.001) were observed following high-intensity interventions versus usual care and at every assessment throughout the length of stay. Changes in Berg Balance Scale and 6-minute walk test were also statistically and clinically different between groups, while secondary measures of Functional Ambulation Category and strength were also different at discharge. Primary predictors of improved walking capacity were steps per day, baseline impairments, and age. Conclusions- Provision of high-intensity stepping training applied during inpatient rehabilitation resulted in significantly greater walking and balance outcomes. This training paradigm should be further tested in other contexts to determine the generalizability to real-world and community settings.",

        "abstract": "\nWhile hypertension and inflammation are physiologically inter-related, the effect of therapies that specifically target inflammation on blood pressure is uncertain. The recent CANTOS (Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study) afforded the opportunity to test whether IL (interleukin)-1&#946; inhibition would reduce blood pressure, prevent incident hypertension, and modify relationships between hypertension and cardiovascular events. CANTOS randomized 10 061 patients with prior myocardial infarction and hsCRP (high sensitivity C-reactive protein) &#8805;2 mg/L to canakinumab 50 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, or placebo. A total of 9549 trial participants had blood pressure recordings during follow-up; of these, 80% had a preexisting diagnosis of hypertension. In patients without baseline hypertension, rates of incident hypertension were 23.4, 26.6, and 28.1 per 100-person years for the lowest to highest baseline tertiles of hsCRP (P>0.2). In all participants random allocation to canakinumab did not reduce blood pressure (P>0.2) or incident hypertension during the follow-up period (hazard ratio, 0.96 [0.85-1.08], P>0.2). IL-1&#946; inhibition with canakinumab reduces major adverse cardiovascular event rates. These analyses suggest that the mechanisms underlying this benefit are not related to changes in blood pressure or incident hypertension. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: https://clinicaltrials.gov.

        "abstract": "\nAlthough the importance of office prehypertension/high normal blood pressure (BP) has been well documented, the significance of ambulatory prehypertension (AmbPreHT) has not been determined. We analyzed markers of target organ damage and hemodynamics in adolescents with AmbPreHT in comparison with hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Out of 304 white patients aged 15.0&#177;2.5 years with office hypertension, 30 children had AmbPreHT and were compared with 66 normotensive healthy children and 92 children with true hypertension (elevated office, ambulatory, and central BP), 22 had ambulatory hypertension (AmbHT), and 70 had severe AmbHT (SevAmbHT). Stroke volume and cardiac output were greater in AmbPreHT compared with patients with normotension but did not differ between AmbPreHT, AmbHT, and SevAmbHT. Similarly, AmbPreHT, AmbHT, and SevAmbHT had similar total peripheral resistance, lower than patients with normotension (P<0.05). Central systolic BP was higher in patients with AmbPreHT, AmbHT, and SevAmbHT compared with normotensives (P<0.01). In all 3 groups, the carotid intima-media thickness Z scores were significantly higher than in normotensive (P<0.001). AmbPreHT and AmbHT patients had higher left ventricular mass index and prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy compared with normotensive but lower compared with SevAmbHT (P<0.001). Pulse wave velocity Z scores were increased in patients with AmbPreHT, AmbHT, and SevAmbHT compared with patients with normotension (P<0.01). Multiple regression analysis showed that body mass index Z score, central systolic BP, and uric acid levels were significant independent predictors of left ventricular mass index. In conclusion, patients with AmbPreHT presented similar cardiovascular adaptations to those observed in patients with hypertensive and may be at risk of developing cardiovascular events.",

        "abstract": "\nBackground: In 2018, the American Physical Therapy Association (APTA) published a clinical guideline for adults with neurological conditions, which included recommendations for the Five-Repetition Sit-to-Stand test (5STSt). According to the APTA, a standard-height chair should be used, but there is no recommendation regarding seat depth. In addition, the APTA recommended the use of one trial of the test, based on expert opinion.Objectives: (1) Compare the 5STSt scores of patients post-stroke and healthy-matched controls using two types of chairs (one standardized and one adjusted to the individual's anthropometric characteristics); and (2) Verify whether different numbers of trial affect the 5STSt scores.Methods: Eighteen patients post-stroke and 18 healthy-matched controls performed three trials of the 5STSt for each type of chair. ANOVA was used for analysis (&#945; = 0.05).Results: No significant interaction between groups and chairs was found. Patients post-stroke showed worsened performances in 5STSt when using both chairs compared to the healthy controls (p = .001). In both groups, the 5STSt scores were lower when using a standardized chair than an adjusted chair (p < .003) and different numbers of trials provided similar 5STSt scores (0.44 &#8804; p &#8804; 0.98).Conclusion: The 5STSt scores were affected by the physical characteristics of the chair, and an adjusted chair should be used. The APTA recommendation for one trial of the 5STSt is supported by the present results.",

        "abstract": "\nThe ischemic stroke is a disease that leads to dysfunctions in life of any individual. The mortality rate of cerebral infarcts reaches up to 39%. Besides, the most acute period of an ischemic stroke, which lasts up to 5-7 days, is especially problematic and is characterized by the highest mortality. The first day of disease results in 21.74% of deaths (out of the total annual number of deaths). The article presents the results of the analysis of treatment of the patients with ischemic stroke caused by the atherosclerosis of brachiocephalic arteries. The role of endovascular technologies in the treatment of the acute cerebrovascular cases has not been fully revealed. The retrospective analysis of treatment of 171 patients with atherosclerotic subtype of ischemic stroke was carried out. The patients were distributed in two groups: in the first group (83 patients) the applied conservative therapy was supplemented by endovascular intervention during the acute period of ischemic insult; in the second group (88 patients) the conservative therapy alone was applied. Both groups were comparable in terms of gender, age and associated diseases. The risk factors of ischemic insult were analyzed such as IHD that requires surgery; hypertensive disease; hypercholesterolemia; ischemic insult in medical history; heart dysrhythmia; diabetes mellitus. All patients had more than one risk factor. There mortality, incapacitation, degree of neurological impairment, frequency of symptoms of hemorrhagic suffusion and of hemorrhagic transformation were analyzed. The remote results were analyzed in sampling of 54 patients: 32 patients from the first group, 22 patients from the second group. The quality of life was measured using technique of non-specific survey SF-36 when its 36 items were grouped into eight scales: physical functioning, role activity, body pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional state, psychological health. The degree of incapacitation was measured with the modified Rankin scale, the quality of life was examined with the SF-36 survey, the survival rate was measured with the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The statistical analysis was carried out with the help of the Statistica 6.0 software.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence of stroke and death in patients with sleep-breathing disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS The anthropometric characteristics, demographic data, and incidence of stroke of 1492 Chinese patients with mild, moderate, or severe sleep apnea were collected. The apnea-hypopnea index was used to define sleep-breathing disorders. Imaging modalities were used to validate the diagnosis of stroke. Death during hospitalization or during follow-up was noted. Multivariate analysis was performed for the incidence of stroke and mortality at the 95% of confidence level. RESULTS Among enrolled patients, 401 (27%) patients had at least 1 event of stroke. Patients who had at least 1 event of stroke were more likely to be younger (p<0.0001), female (p=0.0013), and to have comorbidities. Among enrolled patients, 127 died due to stroke or other diseases. Sixteen of the patients who died had no stroke event(s) and 111 patients who died had at least 1 event of stroke. Stroke events (p=0.023) and biomedical burden of patients were associated with the death of patients with sleep-breathing disorders. CONCLUSIONS Age, sex, and the other existing disease(s) of patients with sleep-breathing disorders may be associated with stroke event(s). Also, stroke event(s) and comorbidities may be associated with mortality in this Chinese population.",

        "abstract": "\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. While work has focused on myelin and axon loss in MS, less is known about mechanisms underlying synaptic changes. Using postmortem human MS tissue, a preclinical nonhuman primate model of MS, and two rodent models of demyelinating disease, we investigated synapse changes in the visual system. Similar to other neurodegenerative diseases, microglial synaptic engulfment and profound synapse loss were observed. In mice, synapse loss occurred independently of local demyelination and neuronal degeneration but coincided with gliosis and increased complement component C3, but not C1q, at synapses. Viral overexpression of the complement inhibitor Crry at C3-bound synapses decreased microglial engulfment of synapses and protected visual function. These results indicate that microglia eliminate synapses through the alternative complement cascade in demyelinating disease and identify a strategy to prevent synapse loss that may be broadly applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases.

A questionnaire on influenza vaccination was followed by short physician-administered verbal instruction on risk of 'heart-attack and stroke' following influenza, ameliorated by vaccination.\nMost patients (n&#8239;=&#8239;100) had cardiovascular risk-factors, many had prior vascular disease. In 2018, 53 % did not intend to be vaccinated. None were aware of the association between influenza and risk of vascular events but when asked again &#8804;7 days after the intervention 34/53 (64 %) stated they will shortly get vaccinated. Charts of 27/34 recorded actual influenza vaccination when examined six weeks later (51 % of 'unwilling' patients). Together with the patients already planning to be vaccinated (47&#8239;+&#8239;27/100) the current target of 70 % vaccinated can be surpassed.\nPending confirmation by a larger RCT, informing elderly patients of the substantial risk of vascular events following influenza and its modification by vaccination may constitute a simple, effective, costless and time-frugal method of changing many patients' often-negative attitudes towards seasonal influenza vaccination. The resulting increased vaccine uptake in vulnerable elderly patients, may improve their influenza-associated morbidity and mortality.\nProviders discussing seasonal influenza vaccination with their patients could inform them of the substantially increased risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke associated with acute influenza to overcome vaccine hesitancy.",

Recently, microbleeds have been identified as one of the factors leading to ICH. While some patients have been found to have recurrent ICH, risk factors for recurrent ICH are scarcely reported. We conducted an observational study on the risk-factors of recurrent ICH, comparing stroke patients with a single hemorrhagic episode and those with recurrent ICH.\nA retrospective analysis of a single-center database was performed to analyze the clinical presentation and characteristics of patients with a single and recurrent ICH. From January 2016 to December 2017, a total of 317 patients were analyzed based on suspected factors including patients' sex, age, medical history, antiplatelet therapy use, and presence of microbleeds on images.\nOf the 317 patients, 36 patients (11.4%) developed a second episode of cerebral hemorrhage. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patients without microbleeds, predicted reduced risk of recurrence. This is the first report strongly associating the presence of microbleeds with the possibility of a recurrent ICH. Other factors under study did not show an apparent association with recurrent ICH probably because of the high statistical significance obtained with the presence of microbleeds.\nOur findings revealed that the absence of microbleeds on images is a factor that strongly predicts a reduced risk for recurrent ICH and that the detection of microbleeds on MRI performed in patients with a single hemorrhagic episode, is useful in defining further therapeutic management. These findings may benefit physicians treating stroke patients.",

Patients were assigned to endovascular treatment according to clinical-radiologic mismatch, NIHSS greater than or equal to 5, and within 6 hours after symptom onset. The endovascular technique is described. Intracranial recanalization, carotid dilatation, and clinical outcomes were retrospectively analyzed.\nSeven patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age was 55 years; 5 patients (71.4%) were male. 71.4% had tandem occlusion strokes, while 28.6% had hemodynamic strokes. The mean onset-to-puncture time was 3.92 hours. Stent-assisted angioplasty for internal carotid artery was done for 85.7% of patients with a mean of 1.6 deployed stents. Dilatation was successful in 83.3% of them. Successful overall recanalization rate was 85.7%. No major complications were encountered. Minor complications occurred in 42.8% of cases. The mean NIHSS score decreased from 13.7 preoperative to 5 after 3 days. Good functional outcome (mRS 0-2) was found in 85.7% of patients at 3 months. No recurrent strokes identified over an average of 40.86 months follow-up.\nOur study provides evidence that endovascular therapy for internal carotid artery dissection-related strokes has high rates of reperfusion and favorable outcomes.

        "abstract": "\nBihemispheric ischemic strokes secondary to unilateral vessel disease are uncommon. We present the case of a 70-year-old man with multiple acute/subacute bilateral infarcts. The patient was found to have stenosis of the left internal carotid artery secondary to herpes zoster ophthalmicus vasculopathy, with involvement of the left proximal middle and anterior cerebral arteries. Angiographic studies also revealed A1 segment aplasia of the right anterior cerebral artery (ACA), thus indicating dependence on the left-sided circulation for perfusion of the bilateral ACA vascular territory. This case illustrates how A1 segment aplasia, an anatomic variant of the circle of Willis detected by angiographic studies, can contribute to bilateral infarction in the ACA vascular territory.",

        "abstract": "\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between shaggy aorta and embolic complications during thoracic endovascular aneurysm repair (TEVAR), based on a shaggy aorta scoring system.\nThe entire aorta was assessed based on 5&#160;mm slice computed tomography (CT) from the sinotubular junction to the aortic bifurcation using a three dimensional workstation. One shaggy point (shaggy score) was given when the following conditions were met: 1) ulcer like thrombus, 2) maximum thrombus thickness&#160;&#8805;&#160;5&#160;mm, and 3) mural thrombus occupies more than two thirds of the circumference of the aortic diameter on reconstructed CT of the axial statue. Subsequently, each point was added to obtain the total shaggy score.\nThe outcomes of 301 patients undergoing TEVAR were evaluated. Post-operative embolic complications including stroke, acute renal failure, and distal embolisation, were identified in 21 cases (7.0%). The average shaggy score for the entire cohort was 2.4&#160;&#177;&#160;5.6 points, whereas it was 7.9&#160;&#177;&#160;7.1 in those patients with embolic complications (E group) and 2.0&#160;&#177;&#160;5.3 in those without embolic complications (N group, p&#160;=&#160;.001). There were no statistical differences in 30 day mortality (p&#160;=&#160;.70), but overall survival at two years was significantly lower in the E group (E: 58.8%, N: 93.3%, p&#160;<&#160;.001). Multivariable analysis revealed that the predictors of post-operative embolic complication were past history of cerebrovascular disease (p&#160;=&#160;.001, OR 5.90, 95% CI 2.14-16.29) and shaggy score (p&#160;<&#160;.001, OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.19). The area under the ROC curve was 0.77, and the cut off value of the shaggy score using the Youden index was 3 points (sensitivity: 71.4%, specificity: 81.4%).\nThis shaggy score is a useful method to predict post-operative embolic complications following TEVAR. Because the risk of embolic complications was relatively high in patients with a high shaggy score, the indication for TEVAR in such patients should be considered carefully.",

        "abstract": "\nLow systolic blood pressure (SBP) is associated with increased mortality and heart failure in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Data on the relation between SBP measured following cardiac resynchronization therapy implantation and subsequent clinical events are limited. We hypothesized that assessment of systolic blood pressure at 12 months after cardiac resynchronization therapy can be used to identify patients with increased risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes. The study population comprised 1000 patients who underwent cardiac resynchronization therapy implantation in MADIT-CRT. Outcomes were compared between patients with low (<110 mm Hg) and preserved SBP (&#8805;110 mm Hg) at 1 year. At 1 year following cardiac resynchronization therapy, 800 patients (80%) had preserved systolic blood pressure. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the rate of heart failure or death during subsequent follow-up was significantly higher among patients with low SBP as compared with a preserved SBP at 12 months (2-year rates: 20% vs 12%, respectively; log-rank p value&#8239;=&#8239;0.009 for the overall difference during follow-up). Consistently, multivariate analysis showed that patients with preserved SBP at 1 year had a 29% lower risk of HF or death when compared with the low SBP group (p&#8239;=&#8239;0.024). The association between SBP measured following cardiac resynchronization therapy implantation and subsequent clinical events was more pronounced among patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (p value for SBP-by-HF etiology interaction&#8239;=&#8239;0.034). In conclusion, assessment of SBP following cardiac resynchronization therapy can be used for improved long-term risk stratification in this population.",

        "abstract": "\nPlatelet expression of Fc&#947;RIIa was quantified after myocardial infarction (MI) and we found that patients with high platelet Fc&#947;RIIa expression (>11,000/platelet) had a fourfold greater risk of subsequent MI, stroke, and death. This analysis of the original cohort of 197 patients was designed to determine whether platelet expression of Fc&#947;RIIa could be used in combination with clinical risk scores (GRACE [Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events] and DAPT [Dual Antiplatelet Therapy]) to refine cardiovascular risk assessment. Platelet expression of Fc&#947;RIIa quantified with the use of flow cytometry was broadly distributed in patients stratified into high and low risk groups based on clinical risk scores. In patients identified as high risk by the GRACE score, 62% had high platelet Fc&#947;RIIa expression. Similarly, in patients identified as high risk by DAPT, 55% had high platelet Fc&#947;RIIa expression. High platelet Fc&#947;RIIa expression discriminated high and low risk cohorts in patients with high cardiovascular risk defined by either the GRACE score (high platelet Fc&#947;RIIa 18.9% vs low platelet Fc&#947;RIIa 0%; odds ratio&#8239;=&#8239;15.7, p&#8239;=&#8239;0.06) or the DAPT score (high platelet Fc&#947;RIIa 15.4% vs low platelet Fc&#947;RIIa 3.7%; odds ratio&#8239;=&#8239;5.6, p&#8239;=&#8239;0.03) assessment. Platelet expression of Fc&#947;RIIa merits additional study to determine whether low platelet Fc&#947;RIIa expression can be used to guide early transition to aspirin monotherapy and high platelet Fc&#947;RIIa expression can be used to guide continuation of DAPT.",

We investigate the association of elevated hs-TnI with clinical outcomes and explore the utility of hs-TnI for risk assessment in patients with newly detected AF. From August 2014 to December 2016, 2,361 consecutive patients with newly detected AF were enrolled in a retrospective, single-center registry. Of these, 957 patients were selected and classified into 4 groups according to hs-TnI quartiles. The primary outcome was all-cause death during follow-up. The hs-TnI level was 3.6 ng/L or less in the lowest quartile (Q1), more than 3.6 ng/L to 10.1 ng/L or less in the second quartile (Q2), more than 10.1 ng/L to 22.0 ng/L or less in the third quartile (Q3), and more than 22.0 ng/L in the highest quartile (Q4). The median follow-up period was 19.3 months. In multivariable Cox regression model, Q4 has a higher risk of all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 3.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.21 to 10.00; p&#8239;=&#8239;0.02), readmission for heart failure (adjusted HR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.01-3.05; p = 0.04), and readmission for revascularization (adjusted HR: 3.90; 95% CI: 1.25 to 12.17; p&#8239;=&#8239;0.02) compared with Q1. Independent predictors of all-cause death were renal insufficiency (adjusted HR: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.08 to 3.53; p = 0.02), highest hs-TnI quartile (adjusted HR: 3.30; 95% CI: 1.18 to 9.27; p = 0.02) and anticoagulation therapy (adjusted HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.93; p = 0.03). Elevated hs-TnI is independently associated with higher mortality in patients with AF and serves as a valuable prognostic biomarker in patients with newly detected AF.",
