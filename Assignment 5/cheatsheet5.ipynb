    "In this exercise, you are asked to pull some data from an API, clean it, and then use it to construct your own server/API in flask. We have already covered how to get and clean data, so consult previous cheatsheets if you need a refresher. The only novel part of this exercise is the Flask server, so let's go over the basics of Flask together. It is generally easier to run a Flask app using a .py file from the console, so for this exercise, we'll also be using some other files in this folder. The explanations will stay in this notebook, but please consult the .py files as we move forward."
