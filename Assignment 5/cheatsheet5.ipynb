We have already covered how to get and clean data, so consult previous cheatsheets if you need a refresher. The only novel part of this exercise is the Flask server, so let's go over the basics of Flask together. It is generally easier to run a Flask app using a .py file from the console, so for this exercise, we'll also be using some other files in this folder. The explanations will stay in this notebook, but please consult the .py files as we move forward."

    "1. Another quad tree, or \"branch\" node, if that region contains multiple data points. \n",
    "2. A leaf node, which contains a a single data point inside that child node's region, called the \"value\" of the node.\n",
    "3. The python value of `None`, which signifies that the child node's region is empty. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each node must also keep track of the coordinates of its left, right, upper, and lower boundaries so that the tree knows where to store each point.\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a quadtree based on a set of data points, our goal is to divide up space so that each leaf-node's region contains at most one data point.\n",
    "For efficiency's sake, we don't further divide up any region that contains only zero or one point.\n",

    "The root node represents the rectangular region bounded by 0 from below, 127 from above, 0 from the left, and 127 from the right.\n",
    "The root node will also use those boundaries to calculate vertical and horizontal lines $x=63.5$ and $y=63.5$, which are used to subdivide the rectangle into four congruent subrectangles, each belonging one of the root node's children.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Here we arbitrarily chose that each dividing line will split the region in half geometrically. For datasets with non-uniform distributions in space, this can be inefficient. You could alternatively set each dividing line to be the median x or y coordinate of all the data points in the region. While this choice improves efficiency, it is not able to handle a dynamic dataset with points being added or removed over time."
